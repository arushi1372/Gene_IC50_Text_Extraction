To test whether Cd exposure would increase Ca release from bone during pregnancy and lactation in relation to the etiological mechanism of Itai-Itai disease, virgin female mice with 45Ca prelabeled skeletons (15 microCi/mouse) were subjected to one round of pregnancy/lactation and were exposed to a Ca-deficient diet containing 0, 5, or 25 ppm Cd or 25 ppm Pb for 32 days, from conception until Lactation Day 14.
