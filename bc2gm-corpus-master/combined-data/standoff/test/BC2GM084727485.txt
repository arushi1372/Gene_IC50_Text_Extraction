Comparison of the 5' flanking regions of the mouse J kappa elements, including the conserved putative recombination target sequences, shows no obvious differences consistent with the variation in recombinational efficiency, so we conclude that, although the consensus heptamer and nonamer signals may be sufficient to identify a recombination site, the probability that that site will be used depends also on other determinants.
