We exposed Dorper-cross ewes at approximately 120-135 days of gestation to a hot (40 degrees C, 60% relative humidity) and a cold (4 degrees C, 90% relative humidity) environment and to treadmill exercise (2.1 km/h, 5 degrees gradient) and measured fetal lamb and ewe body temperatures using previously implanted abdominal radiotelemeters.
