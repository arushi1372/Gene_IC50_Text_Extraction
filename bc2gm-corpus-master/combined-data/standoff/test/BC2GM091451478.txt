Plasmid subclones of the hr1a-containing AcMNPV HindIII-N fragment were examined for their ability to replicate in virus-infected (Spodoptera frugiperda) Sf9 cells, and to stimulate transcription when linked in cis with a 39K gene promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusion and cotransfected into cells along with a plasmid (ple-1) containing the gene encoding the trans-acting factor IE-1.
