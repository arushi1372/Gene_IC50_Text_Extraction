Analysis of the 5' and 3' termini of the transcripts produced in vivo from the puf operon of R. sphaeroides PUF delta 348-420 (three transcripts; 0.59, 0.64, and 2.63 kilobases) lacking the puf-intercistronic terminator structure were identical to those of the corresponding puf transcripts derived from wild-type R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (four transcripts; 0.50, 0.66, 0.71, and 2.7 kilobases) showing that the transcripts begin and end at the same sites.
