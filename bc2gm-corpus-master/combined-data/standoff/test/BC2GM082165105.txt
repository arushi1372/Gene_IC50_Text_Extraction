Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to calculate the 5-year survival probabilities with respect to the following variables: age (< or = 65, > 65), sex, depth of invasion (mucosal, submucosal) tumor location (upper, middle and lower third), gross appearance (type I, type II and type III), size (< or = 1.5 cm, > 1.5 cm), presence or absence of lymph node metastasis, histological type (intestinal, diffuse), extent of lymphadenectomy (limited or extended), and type of gastrectomy (total or distal subtotal).
