In patients, 750 mL of saline lowered DL(CO) (-8%, P<0.01 versus baseline), D(M) (-10%, P<0.01 versus baseline), aldosterone (-29%, P<0.01 versus baseline), renin (-52%, P<0.01 versus baseline), and hematocrit (-6%, P<0.05 versus baseline) and increased V(C) (20%, P<0.01 versus baseline), without changing rap and wpp.
