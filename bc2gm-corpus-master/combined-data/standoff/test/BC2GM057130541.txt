Since 1985 the combination of chlorambucil (10 mg daily, initially for six weeks, then alternating fortnights for 12 weeks) and interferon-alpha 2b (Schering-Plough; 2 x 10(6) U/m2 three times weekly by subcutaneous injection for 18 weeks) has been compared in a randomised trial with chlorambucil alone in previously untreated patients with stage III or IV follicular lymphoma.
