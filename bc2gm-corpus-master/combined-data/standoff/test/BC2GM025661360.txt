Previous studies showed that a palindromic sequence located at -159 base pairs is essential for induction of cutinase gene in Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Nectria haematococca mating type VI) by the hydroxy fatty acids from plant cutin and that a 50-kDa nuclear protein binds to a promoter that contains this element.
