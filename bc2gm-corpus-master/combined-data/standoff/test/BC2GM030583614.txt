Two human beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases forming the core 2 O-glycan branch, C2GnT and the I antigen, IGnT, are homologous to each other in three regions of the catalytic domain (A, B, C) and their genes reside at the same locus, chromosome 9, band q21 (Bierhuizen,M.F.A., Mattei, M.-G. and Fukuda,M., Genes Dev., 7, 468-478, 1993).
