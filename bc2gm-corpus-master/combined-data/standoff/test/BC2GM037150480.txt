Taken together, these results demonstrate that the BSMV coat protein is the sole translation product of the genomic RNA beta, whereas sgRNA beta 1 serves as a messenger for translation of the beta b protein, and sgRNA beta 2 functions as a messenger for translation of beta c and beta d and the newly discovered beta d' protein.
