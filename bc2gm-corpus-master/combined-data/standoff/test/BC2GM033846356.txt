Southern hybridization of genomic DNA from WT and Lp/Lp embryos failed to identify specific rearrangements at or near the Nhlh1 locus, and Northern RNA blotting and RT-PCR evaluation of Nhlh1 mRNA expression indicated that both the levels and types of Nhlh1 mRNAs produced in WT and Lp/Lp embryos were indistinguishable.
