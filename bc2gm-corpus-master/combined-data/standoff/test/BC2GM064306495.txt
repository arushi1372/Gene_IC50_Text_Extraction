When the measured beta-galactosidase activity in the pWP-transfected cells was normalized to the pCH110-transfected cells (an appropriate control if the SV40 early region promoter functions constitutively in various cell lines), the results suggested that the promoter region of the PLP gene contains the information necessary for initiation of transcription in a C6 cell-specific manner.
