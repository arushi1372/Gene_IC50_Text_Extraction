In fifty non selected ductal carcinomas of the breast we found that a marked tumoral inflammatory infiltrate (P less than 0.025), perinodal tumoral infiltrate (P less than 0.01), sinus catarrh (P less than 0.05), follicular hyperplasia (P less than 0.025), mixed pattern in lymph nodes (P less than 0.01) and with 54 years of age or younger (P less than 0.01) correlated significantly with lymph node metastases and/or high histologic grade.
