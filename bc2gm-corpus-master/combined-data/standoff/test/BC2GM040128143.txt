Overexpression of either Sp1 or phosphorylated CREB transactivated the mCgA promoter dose dependently, while coexpression of both transcription factors resulted in an additive mCgA promoter response. mCgA -92 to -64 bp, comprising the Sp1/Egr-1 site and the CRE motif, conferred gastrin responsiveness to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter system, and therefore functions as a "true" enhancer element.
