A DNA binding protein was identified which binds to two novel target-like sequences: (i) at the 5' flanking site of the breakpoint junction of chromosome 8 in a patient with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carrying the t(8;14)(q24;q11) rearrangement and (ii) on chromosome 1 in three of five T-ALL patients with the t(1;14)(p32;q11) rearrangement.
