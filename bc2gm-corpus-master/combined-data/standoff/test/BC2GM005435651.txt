The longest S1-S2 interval at which S2 failed to capture (effective refractory period) was longer by 5.5 +/- 8.2 msec at twice threshold (0.05 less than p less than 0.10) and 5.5 +/- 3.5 msec at 5 times threshold stimulation (p less than 0.01) when the basic drive and extrastimuli were delivered to separate sites.
