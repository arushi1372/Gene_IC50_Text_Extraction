A genomic clone of the chicken osteopontin-encoding gene (opn) was isolated and found to be organized as follows: an untranslated 5' exon; a signal peptide; a recognition sequence for phosphorylation by casein kinase II; a domain containing a possible O-linkage site for glycosylation; a second casein kinase II phosphorylation site; an exon containing three functional regions, the poly-Asp sequence of seven consecutive Asp residues, the RGD integrin recognition site and a potential N-linkage site for glycosylation; and a large C-terminal exon which also contains a potential N-linkage site for glycosylation.
