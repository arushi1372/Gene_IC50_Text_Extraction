Computer analysis revealed that the human protein P1 sequence corresponding to amino acid residues within the N-terminal RNA binding domain displays high homology (greater than 54% identity; 61 to 94% similarity) with two animal virus proteins which possess RNA binding activity (vaccinia virus E3L; rotavirus VP2) and two proteins of unknown function (murine TIK; rotavirus NS34), but which are likely RNA binding proteins.
