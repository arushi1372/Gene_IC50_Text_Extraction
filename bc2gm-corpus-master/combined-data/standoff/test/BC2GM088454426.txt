RESULTS: Analysis by Pearson's correlation showed that the subjects who had higher scores of SSMS during the drum rotation generated the following: a) a higher rating of over-all sickness (r = 0.76); b) a higher ratio of spectral power of EGG at 4-9 cycles per minute (cpm) between drum rotation and baseline periods (r = 0.63); c) a higher net percent increase of spectral power in the EEG frequency band 0.5-4 Hz between drum rotation and baseline periods on C3 (r = 0.29) and C4 (r = 0.31); d) a higher ratio of spectral power of EEG frequency band 0.5-4 Hz between drum rotation and baseline periods on C3 (r = 0.31); and e) a higher level of net increase in skin conductance from baseline to drum rotation (r = 0.30).
