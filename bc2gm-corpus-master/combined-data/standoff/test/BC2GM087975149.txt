The possible equivalency of a short form and the long form of the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List-Revised (MAACL-R; Zuckerman & Lubin,1985) was studied by correlating both forms of the MAACL-R with the State Trait Personality Inventory (Spielberger,1995); the Affect Balance Scale (Bradburn,1969); and the Sensation Seeking Scale (Zuckerman,1978).
