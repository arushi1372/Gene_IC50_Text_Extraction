The dynamics of N-interaction and N-retention during 3 hr CPB was quantified with autologous In-111 labeled neutrophils (INN) in 4 groups of 20 Yorkshire pigs (28-35 kg, 5 sham; 5 CPB, 1 hr; 5 CPB, 3 hr and 5 CPB with heparinized circuit, 3 hr); anesthetized pigs were injected with INN (500-650 microCi), 30 min before CPB and heparinized, and underwent CPB with a roller pump, a hollow fiber OX (Bentley CM 50, 5.0 m2) and AF (Bentley AF 025, 0.25 m2) at 2.5-3.6 l/min for 3 hr.
