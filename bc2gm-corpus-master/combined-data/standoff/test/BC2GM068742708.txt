RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the mean serum vitamin A, E concentrations and vitamin E/cholesterol ratio between pregnant women with normal hemoglobin and hemoglobinopathies, while confounding variables that might affect serum vitamin levels i.e. maternal age, gravida, BMI, gestational age, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and blood group were not different.
