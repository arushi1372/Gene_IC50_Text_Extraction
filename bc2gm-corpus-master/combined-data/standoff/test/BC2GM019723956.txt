To assess whether thallium-201 thallous chloride (Tl) can detect childhood tumors and whether diagnostic effectiveness improves with combined blood flow imaging, 28 children (1.0-18.6 years) were studied using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): Tl (1.3-1.8 mCi intravenously), followed in 13 of the patients by technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO; 8-18 mCi intravenously).
