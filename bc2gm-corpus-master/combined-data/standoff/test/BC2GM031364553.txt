In marked contrast to the previously published human CD6 sequence, the mouse sequence predicts a long cytoplasmic tail that is not closely related to other proteins and possesses two proline-rich motifs containing the SH3-domain binding consensus sequence, three protein kinase C phosphorylation site motifs, nine casein kinase-2 phosphorylation site motifs, and a serine-threonine-rich motif repeated three times.
