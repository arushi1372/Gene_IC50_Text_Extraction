The in-plane orientational anisotropy of the 8CB films grown on unidirectionally photopolymerized PVCN substrates is considerably lower than the intrinsic surface orientational anisotropy of these substrates, which can explain the generally found weak surface anchoring of liquid crystals on PVCN alignment layers.
