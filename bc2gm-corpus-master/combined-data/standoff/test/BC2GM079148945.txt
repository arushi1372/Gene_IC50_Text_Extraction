Arterial compliance measurements using intraarterial pulse contour analysis and a modified Windkessel model were carried out in 19 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (> or = 160/< or = 90 mm Hg) and compared to measurements in 29 patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] > or = 95 mm Hg) and 47 normotensive control subjects.
