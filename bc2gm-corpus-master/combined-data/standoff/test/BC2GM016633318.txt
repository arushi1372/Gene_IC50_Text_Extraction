In two separate studies, specimens of saliva from 57 individuals over the age of 65 years (mean age, 76.7 years) and 37 persons under the age of 40 years (mean age, 28.8 years) were examined for concentrations of IgA as functions of volume, total protein, and electrolyte conductivity; some were also tested for IgG and IgM content.
