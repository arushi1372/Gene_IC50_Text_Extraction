Together with the up-regulation of the cAMP response element modulator protein (CREM) mRNA and protein levels demonstrated previously in CREB mutant mice, we suggest that the up-regulation of CREB beta may also contribute to compensation within the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors, when CREB delta and CREB alpha are absent.
