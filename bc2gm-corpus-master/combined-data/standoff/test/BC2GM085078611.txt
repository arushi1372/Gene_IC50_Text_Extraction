Significant reductions were noted in vertical GRFs per newton of body weight exerted at 10% (P = 0.0009) and 20% (P = 0.0383) of stance phase and in anteroposterior GRFs exerted at 10% (P = 0.0009) and 50% (P = 0.0033) of stance phase when ambulation was compared with and without the orthotic device.
