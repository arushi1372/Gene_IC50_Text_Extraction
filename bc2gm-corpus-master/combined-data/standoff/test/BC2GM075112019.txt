Maximum baroreceptor activity measured at 140 mm Hg and the slope of the pressure-activity curve were reduced in atherosclerotic (n = 15) compared with normal (n = 13) rabbits (425 +/- 34 versus 721 +/- 30 spikes per second and 6.2 +/- 0.6 versus 10.8 +/- 0.8 spikes per second per mm Hg, respectively, P < .05).
