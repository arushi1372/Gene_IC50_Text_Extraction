We describe a novel stat-related factor, p93, that is found in EGF-treated A431 cell extracts but appears to be absent in bovine fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and untreated cells. p93 appears to be antigenically related to stat91. p185c-neu+, EGFr+ (M1), and p185c-neu- kinase inactive, EGFr+ (NEN757) expressing cells undergo different mitotic responses to EGF.
