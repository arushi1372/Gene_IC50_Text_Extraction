In the clinical study, the defect size shown by BMIPP imaging was greater in anterior than in inferior infarcts (p < 0.001) and correlated well with the risk area revealed by contrast ventriculography (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001) CONCLUSION: The above preliminary data, admittedly from a small group of patients, suggest that tomographic BMIPP imaging provides an accurate quantification of defect size by means of a simple threshold technique and, in the subacute phase, permits determination of the amount of myocardium at risk after acute myocardial infarction.
