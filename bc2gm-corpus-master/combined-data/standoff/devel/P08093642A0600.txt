In addition, a microsatellite repeat polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 71% at the RET locus and a restriction fragment length polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 42% detected by a lambda clone from the D10S94 locus have been developed for high-resolution genetic linkage mapping and predictive diagnostic testing.
