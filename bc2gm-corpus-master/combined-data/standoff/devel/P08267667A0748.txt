Repeated administration of GRg2 20 mg/kg i.p. significantly improved the CYP-induced recognitional deficits by increasing the CYP-decreased rate from 55.8 +/- 9.6 to 80.8 +/- 4.2 in d 3 learning acquisition (F(1,14) = 5.6, p < 0.05), from 53.4 +/- 8.4 to 60.0 +/- 8.2 in 48 h memory acquisition (F(1,14) = 7.5, p < 0.05) and from 55.0 +/- 5.5 to 88.3 +/- 2.5 in 24 h memory retention (F(1,12) 27.5, p < 0.01) as well as from 60.0 +/- 6.8 to 85.6 +/- 6.9 in 48 h memory retrieval (F(1,12) = 5.2, p < 0.05), respectively.
