RESULTS: Patients in Group A had a higher incidence of posterolateral wall motion abnormalities (p < 0.001) on radionuclide ventriculography, a larger infarct area (as evidenced by higher peak creatine kinase levels) (p < 0.02) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at hospital discharge (p < 0.008) than those in Group B.
