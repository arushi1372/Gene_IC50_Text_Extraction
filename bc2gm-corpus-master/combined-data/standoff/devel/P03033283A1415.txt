The previously described four sets of 13- to 18-base-pair interspersed repeat elements between -55 and -580 provide most of the high basal transcriptional strength, whereas the arrangement of further upstream tandemly repeated NF1-binding sites may contribute significantly to the expanded biological host range for expression of SCMV IE94 compared with HCMV IE68.
