The promoter region (P1) corresponding to the main group of transcription initiation sites is devoid of TATA and CAAT boxes but has putative binding sites for the transcription factor SP1 and is embedded in a large G + C-rich domain of a CpG island, features shared by the promoters of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes.
