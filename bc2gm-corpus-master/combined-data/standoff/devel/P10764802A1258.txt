These data show that the alpha-helix domain of p57(Kip2), which is conserved in the Cip/Kip proteins, is implicated in protein-protein interaction and confers a specific regulatory mechanism, outside of their Cdk-inhibitory activity, by which the p57(Kip2) family members positively act on myogenic differentiation.
