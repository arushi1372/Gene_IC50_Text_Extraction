To determine which sequences in the rat P450c17 promoter may be responsible for basal and cAMP-stimulated gene transcription, deletion constructs containing between -1,560 and -53 base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA from the rat P450c17 gene were ligated to plasmids expressing the reporter gene luciferase and transfected into two mouse cell lines, adrenal Y-1 cells, and testicular Leydig MA-10 cells.
