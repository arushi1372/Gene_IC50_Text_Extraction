We conclude that (a) the likelihood of detecting carcinoma or atypical hyperplasia exclusively in the adipose tissue component of grossly benign breast biopsies is extremely low, and (b) a possible cost-effective method of sampling grossly benign breast biopsies consists of initially submitting a maximum of 10 blocks of fibrous parenchyma for each case, then examining the remaining tissue histologically only if carcinoma or atypical hyperplasia is found among these blocks.
