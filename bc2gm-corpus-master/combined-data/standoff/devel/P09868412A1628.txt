CONCLUSION: Our study shows that (1) total body BMD and femoral neck BMD were significantly higher in the study group that performed weight-bearing exercises than in control subjects, (2) swimming exercise had no effect on BMD, and (3) although swimming is not a bone-building exercise, it can significantly improve shoulder, back, and grip muscle strength.
