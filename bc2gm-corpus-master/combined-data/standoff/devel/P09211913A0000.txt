Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a component of the transcription factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1, which transactivate their target genes, such as CYP1A1 and erythropoietin, in response to xenobiotic aromatic hydrocarbons and to low O2 concentration, respectively.
