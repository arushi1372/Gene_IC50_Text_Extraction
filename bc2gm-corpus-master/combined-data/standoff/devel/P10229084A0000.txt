Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of anti-p59fyn immunoprecipitates obtained from non-transformed resting human T lymphocytes resulted in the identification of an oligomeric protein complex which is constitutively formed between Fyn and several additional phosphoproteins (pp43, pp72, pp85, the protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2, as well as the two recently cloned adaptor proteins, SKAP55 and SLAP-130).
