In 11 patients with Horton's headache morphological investigations (differential white blood cell count), cytoenzymatic determinations (alkaline and acid phosphatase, non-specific esterase) and cytoimmunological tests (IgM and IgG binding) were carried out on capillary blood neutrophils obtained from the area of pain, non-painful area of the skin on the head on the contralateral side, and from the finger.
