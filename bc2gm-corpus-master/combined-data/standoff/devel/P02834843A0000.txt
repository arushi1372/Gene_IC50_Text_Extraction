The bactericidal activity of six new rifamycin derivatives--rifabutin (RBU), FCE 22250 (F22), rifapentine (RPE), CGP 29861 (C29), CGP 7040 (C70) and CGP 27557 (C27) and rifampicin (RMP)--have been measured against log phase and, as a better test of sterilising activity, against stationary phase cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv.
