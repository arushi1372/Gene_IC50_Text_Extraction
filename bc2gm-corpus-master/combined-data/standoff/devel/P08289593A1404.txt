However, artificially ventilated rats, pretreated with MK-801, were more sensitive (lethal cocaine dose, 76.6 +/- 8.0 mg/kg, n = 5) than vehicle pretreated rats (129.4 +/- 15.8 mg/kg, n = 6), indicating that MK-801 may increase both the respiratory and the cardiac toxicity of cocaine in urethane anesthetized rats.
