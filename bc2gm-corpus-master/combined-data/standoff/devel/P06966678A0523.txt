The monoexponential rate of clearance of tracer--obtained from the portion of the residue-detection curve reflecting metabolism of fatty acid incorporated into neutral lipids--correlated directly with induced changes in tension-time index after injections into the left atrium (r = 0.96, n = 12), right atrium (r = 0.86, n = 14), and ear vein (r = 0.93, n = 14).
