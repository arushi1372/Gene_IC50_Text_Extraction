The dichloromethane is removed, mobile phase solvent is added, and aliquots are injected onto a PRP-1 liquid chromatographic column; fluazifop acid is separated from coextracted compounds and detected at an applied potential of + 1.25 V, using an amperometric electrochemical detector in the oxidation mode.
