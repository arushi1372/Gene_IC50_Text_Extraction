Since the UfAP and UTMP share many biosynthetic and structural features that include site of biosynthesis in the endometrium, P4-responsiveness, the presence of the mannose 6-phosphate lysosomal recognition marker, and considerable sequence similarity, the UfAP and the UTMP may have homologous function which for both still remains obscure.
