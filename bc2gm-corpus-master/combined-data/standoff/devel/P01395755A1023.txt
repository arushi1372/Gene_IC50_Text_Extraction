Consequently, significant differences between the measured and calculated methods were noted in oxygen uptake (213 +/- 41 ml/min vs 193 +/- 25 ml/min, p < 0.001), oxygen delivery (780 +/- 297 ml/min vs 716 +/- 296 ml/min, p < 0.001), and cardiac output (5.8 +/- 2.2 L/min vs 5.3 +/- 1.8 L/min, p < 0.001).
