Despite significant lethality and cardiovascular dysfunction, in the septic group on Days 1 and 2, septic versus control animals had no significant differences in mean metabolic cart measured (Vo2DIR, ml/kg/min; Day 1: 11.9 versus 12.4, p = 0.81; Day 2: 14.2 versus 13.5, p = 0.72, respectively) and intravascular catheter calculated (Vo2INDIR, ml/kg/min; Day 1: 11.2 versus 11.2, p = 0.99; Day 2: 12.8 versus 15.4, p = 0.49, respectively).
