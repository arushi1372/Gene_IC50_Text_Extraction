Dilutions of H-2b or H-2d NP peptides indicated that 3-4 logs less H-2b NP peptide was required to sensitize syngeneic target cells for CTL-specific lysis, suggesting that the differing affinities of H-2b and H-2d major histocompatibility complex molecules for their peptides likely account for the total removal of NP CTL in the H-2b mice but only partial removal in H-2d mice made to express thymic NP.
