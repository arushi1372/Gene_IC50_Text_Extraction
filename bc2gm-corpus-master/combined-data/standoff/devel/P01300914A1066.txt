In the absence of histological criteria, which it is difficult to demand in view of the variability of results and potential dangers of endomyocardial biopsy involving such thin and fragile ventricular walls, the diagnosis of ACRV is based upon the concomitant existence of: (1) electrophysiological criteria: ventricular arrhythmias, in particular sustained monomorphous VT, with the particular feature of a very high degree of sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation (exercise), the existence of late potentials on the high amplification ECG, a highly specific sign, though unfortunately of poor sensitivity in localized froms, those which are most difficult to identify (2); segmentary morphological and kinetic RV abnormalities, most often resulting in localized akinetic or dyskinetic parietal vaulting, with stasis "in situ".
