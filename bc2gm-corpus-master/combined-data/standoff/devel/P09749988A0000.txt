Badcock and Westheimer (Spatial Vision 1 (1), 3-11, 1985) showed that a thin vertical line induces nearby zones of attraction and repulsion; this study extends those results by more closely examining the horizontal and vertical extents of the repulsion zone and by using an illusory contour to induce repulsion.
