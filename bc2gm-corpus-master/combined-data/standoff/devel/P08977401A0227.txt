The RI alpha gene is composed of nine coding exons of varying lengths, separated by introns, giving the gene a total length of at least 21 kb. our recent cloning of a processed RI alpha pseudogene with a 5'-noncoding region different from the previously reported RI alpha complementary RNA indicated that the RI alpha gene may have multiple leader exons giving rise to alternately spliced messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
