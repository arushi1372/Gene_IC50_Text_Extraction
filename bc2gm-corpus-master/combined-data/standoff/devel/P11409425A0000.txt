We used stored plasma samples from 409 patients in the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) Stroke Trial to examine the relationship between an apolipoprotein (Apo) E2 or an Apo E4 phenotype and a favorable outcome 3 months after stroke, the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, and the response to intravenous t-PA therapy.
