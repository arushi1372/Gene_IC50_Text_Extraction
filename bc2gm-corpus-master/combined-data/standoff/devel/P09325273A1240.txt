These results suggest that UBP41 may play an important role in the recycling of ubiquitin by hydrolysis of branched poly-ubiquitin chains generated by the action of 26 S proteasome on poly-ubiquitinated protein substrates, as well as in the production of free ubiquitin from linear poly-ubiquitin chains and of certain ribosomal proteins from ubiquitin fusion proteins.
