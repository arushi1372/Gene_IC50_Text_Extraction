In conclusion: (i) TECRA kit is suggested to be used for screening SE producing strains; (ii) SET-RPLA and RIDASCREEN kits are suitable for epidemiological investigation of SE types, but the lack of ability for detecting SEE, long time required for testing with SET-RPLA kit and high background when using RIDASCREEN kit must be overcome; and (iii) because of the complicated test procedures and the lack of ability for detecting SEE, the practicality of SET-EIA kit in screening and epidemiological research purposes is low.
