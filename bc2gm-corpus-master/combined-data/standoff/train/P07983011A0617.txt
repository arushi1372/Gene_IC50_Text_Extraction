Sequence analysis revealed: 1) a kinase catalytic domain most characteristic of serine/threonine kinases but hybrid between members of the family of microtubule-associated protein kinase kinase kinases and the fibroblast growth factor receptor family; 2) two putative alpha-helical leucine zipper motifs separated by a 25-amino acid charged intermediate segment but lacking an NH2-terminal basic domain; and 3) COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal proline-rich domains suggestive of src homology 3 (SH3) domain binding regions.
