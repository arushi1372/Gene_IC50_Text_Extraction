A protocol is elaborated for the preparation and characterization of a quality control material (QCM) containing intrinsic concentration of cadmium (Cd) (0.8 microgram/L) and lead (Pb) (13.4 micrograms/dL) from bovine blood and an elevated QCM containing Cd (5.0 micrograms/L), mercury (Hg) (11.2 micrograms/L), and Pb (34.5 micrograms/dL) from bovine blood spiked with aqueous spiking-solutions prepared with salts of Cd, Hg, and Pb.
