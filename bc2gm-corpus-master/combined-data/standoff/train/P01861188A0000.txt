Plate luting, a technique that uses polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) interposed between the plate and the bone, as well as between the screw heads and the plate, to improve the stability of internal fixation was tested in vitro using 20 paired equine third metacarpal bones with mid-diaphyseal osteotomies plated with six-hole broad ASIF compression plates.
