To test the hypothesis that progestin-mediated increases in resting core temperature and the core temperature threshold for sweating onset are counteracted by estrogen, we studied eight women (24 +/- 2 yr) at 27 degrees C rest, during 20 min of passive heating (35 degrees C), and during 40 min of exercise at 35 degrees C.
