A 7-day treatment of amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day i.p.) significantly reduced the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured as inuline clearance and creatinine clearance (0.74 +/- 0.29 and 0.16 +/- 0.04 ml/min, respectively) in comparison to vehicle-treated rats (2.04 +/- 0.23 and 1.29 +/- 0.19 ml/min, respectively).
