Active complexes eluted at a higher molecular weight than inactive complexes, were relatively deficient in both p21 and p27, and contained Cdk2 with increased threonine 160 phosphorylation, consistent with a mechanism of activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 involving both reduced CDK inhibitor association and CDK-activating kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Cdk2.
