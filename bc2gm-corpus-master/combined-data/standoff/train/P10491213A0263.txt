Serum concentrations of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and osteocalcin (bone Gla protein, BGP), urinary levels of pyridinoline (Pyr) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) and computed tomography (CT) measurements of the cross-sectional areas of the vertebrae and the femurs, the apparent density of cancellous bone in the vertebrae, and the volume and the material density of cortical bone in the femurs were determined in 126 boys and 143 girls, ages 7-18 years.
