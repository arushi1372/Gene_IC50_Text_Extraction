Recent studies have shown that the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, associates with the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 as it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during platelet aggregation: a process that can be mimicked in part by small synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 encompassing tyrosine residues Tyr-663 or Tyr-686.
