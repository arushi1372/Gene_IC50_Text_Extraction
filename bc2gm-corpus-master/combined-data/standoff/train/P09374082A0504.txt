The proposed mechanism of effect states that mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the primary hydrolysis product of DEHP, mimics the inducing prostaglandins (PG) PGD(2), 9alpha,11betaPGF2, and PGF2alpha, and thromboxanes in the lungs, thereby increasing the risk of inducing inflammation in the airways, which is a characteristic of asthma.
