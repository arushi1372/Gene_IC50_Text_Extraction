RESULTS: The subjects in the augmented feedback group significantly reduced their peak vertical ground reaction force in both post-test conditions (2-minute post-test reduction, 0.85+/-0.62; 1-week post-test reduction, 0.74+/-0.58) as compared to the sensory, control I, and control II feedback groups.
