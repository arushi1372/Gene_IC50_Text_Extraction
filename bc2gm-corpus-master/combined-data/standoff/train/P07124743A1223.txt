A limited study in a glassware factory (As2O3 exposure) involving the measurement of total airborne arsenic, the determination of urinary arsenic, and the evaluation of hand and mouth contamination by arsenic before and after the workshift suggests that the high urinary arsenic levels (300 microgram/g creatinine) are likely to be more related to an increased oral intake from contaminated hands than to an increased absorption from the lungs.
