Mutations at three sites have larger effects in muscle than nonmuscle cells; an A/T-rich site mutation has a pronounced effect in both striated muscle types, mutations at the MEF1 (Right E-box) site are relatively specific to expression in skeletal muscle, and mutations at the CArG site are relatively specific to expression in cardiac muscle.
