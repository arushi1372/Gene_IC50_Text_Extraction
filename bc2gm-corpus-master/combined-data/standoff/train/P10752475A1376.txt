These studies identify several of the signal-transduction events involved in the apoptosis of malignant B cells that transpire following ligation of CD20 by anti-CD20 antibodies in the presence of Fc-receptor-expressing cells or secondary goat anti-(mouse Ig) antibodies and which may contribute to the tumor regressions observed in mouse models and clinical trials.
