Only after a pretreatment aimed at increasing its oxide surface layer was titanium powder found to accelerate the precipitation from solutions containing 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 50 mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.2, and to induce precipitation from metastable solutions containing 1.2 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 50 mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.2, at 37 degrees C.
