Antibodies affinity-purified using the bacterially expressed recombinant protein recognized the 56K autoantigen in a HeLa cell extract. cDNA sequencing revealed that the 56K cDNA shares a high degree of homology in both nucleotide (87%) and amino acid sequence (92.5%) with bovine annexin XI, indicating that the 56K cDNA encodes the human homologue of annexin XI, a member of the Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding protein family.
