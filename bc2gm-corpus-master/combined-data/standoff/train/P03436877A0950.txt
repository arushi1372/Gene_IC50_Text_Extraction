Kf,c and CT (referenced to the initial lung mass) decreased linearly with reductions in lung mass % delta Kf,c = 1.26-0.98% mass removed (r = 0.90, P less than 0.01) and % delta CT = -3.99-0.98% mass removed (r = 0.82, P less than 0.01) relationships that were not altered by blocker pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
