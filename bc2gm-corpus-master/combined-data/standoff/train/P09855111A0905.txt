Although we predicted that overexpression of the COOH-terminal domains, which were thought to be involved in the regulation of SREBP processing, would result in disruption of the SREBP-dependent transcriptional regulation of several genes, the mRNA levels for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) synthase in these two cell lines were regulated in a sterol-dependent manner.
