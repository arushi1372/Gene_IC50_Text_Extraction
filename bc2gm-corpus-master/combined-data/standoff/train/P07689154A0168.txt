Protein phosphorylation appears to play a critical role in uPA gene expression in these cells; protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters cooperate with pp60v-src to synergistically increase uPA mRNA, whereas cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase-activating agents (e.g., 8-bromo cAMP) repress uPA mRNA levels.
