All injections of CSF were given after the initiation of neutropenia and continued until the occurrence of an absolute neutrophil recovery. rHu GM-CSF and rHu G-CSF, administered once daily at the 250 microg m(-2) day(-1) and 5 microg kg(-1) day(-1) level, were effective in increasing the absolute neutrophil count and neutrophil function, as measured by an automated chemiluminescence system.
