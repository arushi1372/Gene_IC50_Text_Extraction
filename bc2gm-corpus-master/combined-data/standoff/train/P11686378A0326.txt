Considering that the reactor is thoroughly mixed during each discharge and that LD50 = 0.9 values are nearly independent of E. coli concentrations in the range of 2 x 10(3) < or = E coli/cfu mL(-1) < or = 3 x 10(6), we ascribe the nonexponential Pn decay of single-strain E. coli colonies to a shielding phenomenon where inactive cells protect the successively smaller numbers of viable cells in the EHD.
