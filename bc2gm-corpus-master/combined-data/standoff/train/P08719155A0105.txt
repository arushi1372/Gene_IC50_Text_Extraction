We report here the molecular cloning of a putative adhesive molecule from P. falciparum that shares both sequence and structural similarities with a sporozoite surface molecule from Plasmodium termed the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) and, to a lesser extent, with the circumsporozoite (CS) protein.
