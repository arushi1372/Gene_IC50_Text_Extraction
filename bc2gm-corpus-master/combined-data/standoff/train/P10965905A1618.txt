Because GH-induced Akt activation was completely inhibited in both cells by the same concentration of LY294002, these findings indicate that the wortmannin sensitivity of both the IRS-1-independent and -dependent GH-induced MAP kinase activation may reflect the activity of another wortmannin-sensitive target(s) in addition to PI3K in mediation of GH-induced MAP kinase activation in these cells.
