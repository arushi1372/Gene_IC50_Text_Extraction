Stoichiometric phosphorylation of human p53 at Ser315 stimulates p53-dependent transcription. p53 protein activity as a transcription factor can be activated in vivo by antibodies that target its C-terminal negative regulatory domain suggesting that cellular enzymes that target this domain may play a role in stimulating p53-dependent gene expression.
