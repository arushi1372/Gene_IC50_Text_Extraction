In contrast, rats receiving U74500A (2 mg/kg i.v. infusion commencing 30 min prior to revascularisation) exhibited enhanced GMBF throughout reperfusion [PI 10 min: 3.26 (2.56-3.63); 120 min: 2.03 (1.73-2.25); 240 min: 2.13 (1.75-2.44), p < 0.01 vs. controls and normals] with complete muscle salvage [GMV 100% in all reperfused muscles, p < 0.01 vs. controls, not significant (NS) vs. normals and 6 h ischaemia].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
