In the whole group of infected children, an age-specific z score < -2 for weight and for FFM was significantly associated with an increased risk of death [relative risk (95% CI) = 11.4 (3.1, 41.0) and 5.1 (1.5, 18.2), respectively]; when only children with more severe disease were considered, only z score for weight was significantly associated with an increased risk [4.6 (1.4, 14.9)].
