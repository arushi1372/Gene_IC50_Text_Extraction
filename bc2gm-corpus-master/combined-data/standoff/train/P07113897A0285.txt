There were no significant differences in EF between the two studies, both at rest (56.0 +/- 13.8% vs 58.2 +/- 11.7%, p = NS) and with exercise (51.1 +/- 17.6% vs 54.3 +/- 17.6%, p = NS) and a highly significant correlation was shown between the two groups of values (rest r = 0.90, exercise r = 0.93, p less than 0.001).
