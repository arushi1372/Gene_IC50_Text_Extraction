A method is described for the simultaneous determination of 1, alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) and five active metabolites--noracetylmethadol, dinoracetylmethadol, methadol, normethadol, and dinormethadol--in biofluids by high-performance liquid chromatography using a normal-phase column and a UV detector at 218 nm.
