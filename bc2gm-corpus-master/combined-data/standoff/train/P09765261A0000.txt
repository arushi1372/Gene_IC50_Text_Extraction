The human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type I (HTLV-I) trans-activator, Tax, interacts specifically with the basic-domain/leucine-zipper (bZip) protein, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), bound to the viral Tax-responsive element consisting of three imperfect 21-base pair repeats, each with a cAMP response element core flanked by G/C-rich sequences.
