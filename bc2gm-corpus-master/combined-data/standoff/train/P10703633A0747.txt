Strontium nitrate mixed with glycolic acid, in comparison with glycolic acid alone, markedly (p<0.01) shortened the duration of the irritation sensation from 24.4+/-4.1 (mean+/-SEM) min to 8.9+/-3.7 (mean+/-SEM) min, and significantly (p<0.05) reduced the mean magnitude of the irritation sensation at all time points (overall).
