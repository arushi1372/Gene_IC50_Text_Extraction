In gel mobility shift assays, low binding activity of CBF to the wild-type AtpC promoter sequence was observed with nuclear extracts from tissue with low AtpC expression levels, i.e. extracts from etiolated and photobleached seedlings, whereas high binding activity was detectable with extracts from tissues with high AtpC expression levels, i.e. extracts from light-grown seedlings and etiolated seedlings treated with cytokinin.
