In this regard, we have recently observed that a constitutively active G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV)/human herpes virus 8 is oncogenic and stimulates angiogenesis by increasing the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a key angiogenic stimulator and a critical mitogen for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma.
