The structural similarity between Vav and other guanine nucleotide exchange factors for small GTP-binding proteins, together with the recent identification of biochemical routes specific for members of the Ras and Rho family of GTPases, prompted us to explore whether MAPK or JNK are downstream components of the Vav signaling pathways.
