The overexpressed His6-tagged GrsA derivatives were affinity-purified, and the catalytic properties of the deletion mutants were examined by biochemical studies including ATP-dependent amino acid activation, carboxyl thioester formation, and the ability to racemize the covalently bound phenylalanine from L- to the D-isomer.
