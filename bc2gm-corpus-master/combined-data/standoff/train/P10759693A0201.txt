METHODS: We determined an odds ratio (OR), as a measure of the relative risk of being exposed to a potential interaction, comparing the use of the H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, with that of the noninteracting agents ranitidine, famotidine and nizatidine in users and nonusers of warfarin, phenytoin and theophylline.
