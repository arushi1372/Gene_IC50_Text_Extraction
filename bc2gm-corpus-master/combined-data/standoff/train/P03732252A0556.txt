However, further analyses of the data indicate that increasing VO2 AT (r = -0.63, P less than 0.05) rather than VO2max (r = -0.15) could result in improving the 10,000 m race performance to a larger extent, and that the absolute amount of change (delta) in the 10,000 m run time is best accounted for by a combination of delta VO2 AT and delta 5,000 m run time.
