Dorsal foot TcpO2 was measured by using oxygen-sensing electrodes with surface temperatures of 42 degrees C and 45 degrees C; in theory, changes in sympathetic activity should affect vasomotor tone and TcpO2 in skin beneath an electrode at 42 degrees C (submaximal vasodilation), but not at 45 degrees C (maximal vasodilation).
