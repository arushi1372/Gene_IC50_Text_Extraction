METHODS: P-selectin expression of nonstimulated and ADP-stimulated platelets was flow cytometrically measured before the clopidogrel loading dose and on 3 consecutive days in 52 patients with coronary artery disease: 21 patients in group 1 received 300 mg of clopidogrel after stent implantation and 11 patients in group 2 received the higher 450-mg clopidogrel loading dose followed by a daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel for both groups.
