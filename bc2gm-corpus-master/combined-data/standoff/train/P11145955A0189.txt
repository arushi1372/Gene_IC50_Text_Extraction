The mechanism of ligand-activated estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-dependent activation of gene expression through the SRE was determined by mutational analysis of the promoter, analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation by E2, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) as a positive control.
