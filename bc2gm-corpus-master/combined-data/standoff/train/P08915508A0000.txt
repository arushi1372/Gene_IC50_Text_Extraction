Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-derived pUCMoTiN-based retroviral vectors were engineered to allow constitutive and Tat (trans-activator of transcription)-inducible expression of five hammerhead ribozymes targeted against highly conserved sequences within the group antigen (Gag), protease (Pro), reverse transcriptase (RT), tat, and envelope (Env) coding regions of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) RNA.
