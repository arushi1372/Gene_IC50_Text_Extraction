The predicted Pay4p sequence contains two putative ATP-binding domains and shows structural relationships to other potential ATP-binding proteins involved in biological processes as diverse as peroxisome biogenesis, vesicle-mediated protein transport, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation.
