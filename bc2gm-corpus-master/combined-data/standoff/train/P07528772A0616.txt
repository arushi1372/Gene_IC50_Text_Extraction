To further define the structural requirements for ZAP-70 interaction with the TCR, we developed a binding assay using immobilized glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the NH2- and/or COOH-terminal SH2 domains of ZAP-70, and soluble synthetic peptides with the sequence of the cytoplasmic region of the TCR zeta chain (TCR zeta cyt) or individual TCR zeta and CD3 epsilon TAM motifs.
