To study the functional differences between cutaneous HPV5 and HPV8 E7s and genital HPV16 E7, we cloned each of the E7 open reading frames and tested their immortalizing and transforming activities, the binding ability of their products with retinoblastoma protein (RB) and their complementation activity of a RB-nonbinding adenovirus E1A mutant.
