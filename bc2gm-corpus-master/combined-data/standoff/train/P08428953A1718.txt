This promoter could direct the constitutive expression of the reporter beta-galactosidase at high frequency in transfected colonies of transformed cells that express L-plastin constitutively; by contrast, this promoter was virtually inactive in transfected colonies of normal fibroblasts and it exhibited a low frequency of constitutive activation in transfected colonies of in vitro SV40-transformed fibroblasts which did not exhibit L-plastin expression.
