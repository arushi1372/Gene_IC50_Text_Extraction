Contractile responses to norepinephrine, serotonin and potassium (K+) and relaxant responses to isoproterenol and papaverine were studied in vitro with spirally cut thoracic aortic strips from aortic coarcted hypertensive rats (AHR)2, 6, 14 and 28 days postoperatively and compared to time-matched, sham-operated normotensive controls.
