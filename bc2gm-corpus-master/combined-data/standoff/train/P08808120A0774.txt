Patients with low probability of having aluminum overload (serum iron levels < 40 micrograms/L and DAI < 150 micrograms/L) had significantly higher values of serum iron, iron transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels compared with those patients with a high probability of having aluminum overload (serum aluminum levels > 40 micrograms/L and DAI > 150 micrograms/L).
