It has been established that preoperative irradiation in the form of the fractionation of a single focal dose of 6 Gy every other day, the summary dose of 24 Gy within 8-10 days followed by surgery 1-3 days after irradiation does not either complicate its performance or the course of the postoperative period, and by the short- and long-term results it is no worse than the routine dose fractionation.
