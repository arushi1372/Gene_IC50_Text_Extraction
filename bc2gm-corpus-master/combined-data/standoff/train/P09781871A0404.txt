Glycogen synthesis and catabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, motility, cell surface properties and adherence are modulated by csrA in Escherichia coli, while the production of several secreted virulence factors, the plant hypersensitive response elicitor HrpN(Ecc) and, potentially, other secondary metabolites are regulated by rsmA in Erwinia carotovora.
