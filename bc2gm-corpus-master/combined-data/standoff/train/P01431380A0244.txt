According to out field research, the tick fauna was very rich throughout that area, and it was permissible enough to determine ticks as the vectors, based on arising of anti-SF group rickettsiae (SFGR) antibody in mice inoculated with some tick emulsions, findings of rickettsiae reactive to patient sera or a species-specific monoclonal antibody to JSFR in the hemolymph cells of some ticks, and electron microscopical observations of SFGR in various internal organs including the salivary gland of ticks.
