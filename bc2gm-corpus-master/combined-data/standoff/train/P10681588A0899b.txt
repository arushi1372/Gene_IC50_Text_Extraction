EMSA showed that nuclear proteins from PC12 but not C6 or Rat2 cells bind the CRE as a complex containing activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta, while both PC12 and C6 cell nuclear extracts were recruited by the CCAAT-box as a complex containing nuclear factor Y.
