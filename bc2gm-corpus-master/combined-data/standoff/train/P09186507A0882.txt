Comprising a 126-nucleotide 5' untranscribed genomic sequence and a 466-nucleotide 5' noncoding cDNA sequence, the 592-nucleotide 5' CpG island lacked TATA and CAAT boxes but displayed a high G+C content, was enriched for CpG dinucleotides, and contained a potential Sp1-binding site, i.e., features compatible with a housekeeping gene.
