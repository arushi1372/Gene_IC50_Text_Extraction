Expression of various FAK mutants in the FAK- cells showed that FAK kinase activity, the Tyr-397/SH2 domain binding site, and the first proline-rich SH3 binding region in the FAK C-terminal domain were individually needed to promote full FAK-mediated FAK- cell migration to FN whereas direct paxillin binding to FAK was not required.
