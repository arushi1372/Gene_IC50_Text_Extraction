Using a previously published two-frequency (AC excitation) three-electrode method, the admittance locus plot (ALP) in the low-frequency region (< 1000 Hz) has been shown to be very well approximated by a straight line and can be described with frequency-independent parameters; phase angle alpha pi/2, conductance at extrapolated zero frequency G0 = 1/R0, and ion relaxation time tau.
