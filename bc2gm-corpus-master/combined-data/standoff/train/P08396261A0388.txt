Several lines of evidence demonstrate that this growth inhibition requires active PKA subunits and cAMP: (i) this phenotype is dependent on cAMP since it is not seen in a strain lacking adenylyl cyclase activity, but the growth rate of these transformants is slower when exogenous cAMP is added; (ii) normal growth occurs when wild-type RI cDNA is replaced by a mutant RI cDNA encoding a RI protein with reduced cAMP binding; and (iii) the growth-inhibited phenotype of the transformed BL21(DE3) cells requires soluble, active C alpha protein.
