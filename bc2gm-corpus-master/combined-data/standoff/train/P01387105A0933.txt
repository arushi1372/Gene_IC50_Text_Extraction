Through Southern blot analyses of DNA from backcross and cogenic mice, recombinant inbred strains, and somatic cell hybrids, the genetic loci that produce the cyclin B1-related sequences (designated loci Cycb1-rs1 to Cycb1-rs9) were mapped on mouse chromosomes 5, 1, 17, 4, 14, 13, 7, X, and 8, respectively.
