OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction.
