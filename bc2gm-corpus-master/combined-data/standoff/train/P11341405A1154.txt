CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased cortical thickness and geometric properties of left MCB-IV and -V of Greyhounds, together with altered turnover and orientation of osteons in the dorsal quadrants of left MCB, are site-specific adaptive responses associated with asymmetric cyclic loading as a result of racing on circular tracks.
