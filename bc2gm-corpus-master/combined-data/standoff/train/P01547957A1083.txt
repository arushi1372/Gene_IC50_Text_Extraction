Using a degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) based on the N-terminal aa sequence, plus an internal oligo homologous to a conserved region within the portion of CYP1 and CYP2 that had been deleted in the genome, a CYP3-specific DNA fragment was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using GL81 genomic DNA as a substrate.
