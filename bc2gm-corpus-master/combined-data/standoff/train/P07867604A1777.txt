Our results concluded that 1) the two inhibin/activin beta B-subunit mRNAs were transcribed from different initiation sites; 2) both promoters may be controlled by up-stream negative regulatory elements; and 3) neither of these promoters is responsive to cAMP and/or phorbol esters under the conditions employed.
