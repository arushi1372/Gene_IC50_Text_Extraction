Amplification and overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene in 21MT-2 and 21MT-1 human breast carcinoma cells results in progressively elevated levels of constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated p185erbB-2 and is associated with progressive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and combined IGF/epidermal growth factor (EGF) independence in culture.
