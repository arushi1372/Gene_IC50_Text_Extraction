Following chondroitinase AC and ABC digestion, staining reactions suggested that the highest levels of dermatan sulfate were in the diabetes resistant group (p less than 0.001 compared to diabetic, p less than 0.001 compared to diabetes prone) and the highest levels of chondroitin sulfates were in the diabetes prone group (p less than 0.001).
