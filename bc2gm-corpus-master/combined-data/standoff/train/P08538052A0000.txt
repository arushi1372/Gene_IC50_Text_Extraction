A human recombinant cDNA clone that encoded 253 amino acids residues of a zinc-finger protein (THZif-1) was cloned by screening a cDNA library prepared from human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes that corresponded to the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from the DNA-binding protein specific for the nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) of the human c-myc gene.
