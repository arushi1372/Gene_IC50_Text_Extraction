GTRE, TRE, and CRE oligonucleotides all compete more efficiently for protein binding to their labeled congeners than for protein binding to either of the other labeled oligonucleotides, suggesting that the GTRE, TRE, and CRE oligonucleotides, suggesting that the GTRE, TRE, and CRE oligonucleotides each bind unique as well as common proteins, likely to be members of the Jun/Fos and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factors (CREB/ATF) families of transcription factors, in chromaffin cells.
