Interaction was apparently determined by the N-terminal splice region of RPDE-6, as the PDE4A splice variant RPDE-39, which differs from RPDE-6 at the extreme N-terminus, failed to associate with v-Src-SH3; met26RD1 (where RD1 is rat 'dunc-like' PDE), which has the N-terminal splice region deleted, failed to associate with v-Src-SH3, and the association of RPDE-6 and v-Src-SH3 was blocked by a fusion protein formed from the N-terminal splice region.
