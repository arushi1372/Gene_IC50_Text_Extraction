The present study investigates whether prostaglandins "cytoprotect" the gastric mucosa against hemorrhage-induced stress ulceration by assessing the influence of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (16,16-dm PGE2) on gross and microscopic lesion formation, intramucosal tissue pH, H+ back-diffusion, and mucosal blood flow in rat gastric mucosa exposed to luminal acid (100 mM HCl) during hemorrhagic shock (13 ml/kg for 20 min).
