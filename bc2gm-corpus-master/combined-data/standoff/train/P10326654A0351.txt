According to pilot experiments which considered various durations of global no-flow ischemia ranging from 10 to 20 minutes, two durations were chosen for the present study: 20 minutes (group 20) in which ventricular fibrillation (VF) was the predominant form of arrhythmias, and 18 minutes (group 18) in which the prevalence of VF was markedly lower despite the small difference in the duration of ischemia.
