We conclude that (i) we have identified several candidate latency genes of murine gammaHV68, (ii) expression of genes during latency may be different in different organs, consistent with multiple latency programs and/or multiple cellular sites of latency, and (iii) regions of the viral genome (v-bcl-2 gene, v-GCR gene, and gene 73) are transcribed during latency with both gammaHV68 and primate gammaherpesviruses.
