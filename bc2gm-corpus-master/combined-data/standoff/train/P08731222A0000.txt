The distribution and organization of projections from the spinal cervical enlargement to subnucleus reticularis dorsalis (SRD) and the neighbouring Cuneate nucleus (Cu) area was studied in the rat by using microinjections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into different laminae around the C7 level.
