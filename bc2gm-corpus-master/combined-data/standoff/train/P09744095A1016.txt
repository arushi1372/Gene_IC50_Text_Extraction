Surprisingly, double mutants of the shy2-1D mutant with the phytochrome-deficient mutants hy2, hy3(phyB-1) and fre1-1(phyA-201) showed reduced photomorphogenic response in darkness with a longer hypocotyl, a longer inflorescence stem, and a lower level expression of the CAB gene than the shy2-1D single mutant.
