OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) between a standard antiemetic regimen-chlorpromazine + dexamethasone (CPM-DEX)- and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist-tropisetron (TROP)--in the control of acute emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy in children, considering two analytic perspectives: hospital and patients.
