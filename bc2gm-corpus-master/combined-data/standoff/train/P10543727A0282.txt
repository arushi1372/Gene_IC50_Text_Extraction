It contains binding sites for several transcription factors, for example: (i) a well-characterized binding site for rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors in its 3'-end (the H2TF1 or kappaB1 element), (ii) a second kappaB site (the kappaB2 element), which is located immediately adjacent 5' to the H2TF1 element and which is recognized by p65/relA in the human HLA system, and (iii) an AP-1/ATF recognition sequence in the 5' end (EnA-TRE).
