Mature and old B6AF1 and B6D2F1 mice were given acidified tap water or promethazine HCl (a phenothiazine with H1 receptor blocking activity), chlorpheniramine (an H1 blocker) or trifluoperazine (a phenothiazine with no H1 blocking activity) in their drinking water, and the effects of these agents on bone mineral content were assessed by intermittently measuring the 24-h whole body retention of Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc 99m MDP, an indicator of bone metabolism) and at the end of the studies by determining ash weights of femur, ilium and sacrum.
