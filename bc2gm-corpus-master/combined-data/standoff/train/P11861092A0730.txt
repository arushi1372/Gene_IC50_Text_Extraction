When a plateau of enhancement was reached, a single lesion in each patient was imaged using five different continuous scanning modes, fundamental grey scale (FGS); fundamental colour Doppler (FCD); fundamental power Doppler (FPD); second harmonic grey scale (HGS); and pulse inversion mode (Pim) using an HDI5000 scanner and C5-2 probe (ATL, Bothell, WA).
