PURPOSE: The purposes of the present study were to assess the effects of a 12-wk laboratory based aerobic exercise program on cardiopulmonary function, CD4 cell count, and physician-assessed health status among symptomatic pre-AIDS HIV-infected individuals (N = 28) and to assess the degree to which ill health was associated with exercise relapse.
