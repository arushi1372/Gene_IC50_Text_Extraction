These data showed: that progesterone secretion is pulsatile throughout the human luteal phase, with maximum frequency in the mid-luteal phase; that during the mid-luteal phase most subjects had progesterone levels both above and below currently accepted ovulatory thresholds; the use of a single measurement of progesterone in the mid-luteal phase is not always a reliable indicator of ovulation; a threshold greater than 20 nmol/l may yield an unacceptable number of false negative results.
