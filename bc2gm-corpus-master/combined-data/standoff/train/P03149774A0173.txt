In the IA task, post-training intraperitoneal injections of picrotoxin and bicuculline induced a dose-dependent enhancement of retention measured 24 h after the training, while retention was not affected by bicuculline methiodide (a GABA receptor antagonist that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier).
