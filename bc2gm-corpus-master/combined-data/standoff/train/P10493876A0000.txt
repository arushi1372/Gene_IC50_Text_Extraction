The solution structure of the adduct derived from the covalent bonding of the fjord region (+)-(11S, 12R, 13R, 14S) stereoisomer of anti -11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13, 14-tetrahydrobenzo[g]chrysene, (+)- anti -B[g]CDE, to the exocyclic N(6)amino group of the adenine residue dA6, (designated (+)- trans-anti -(B[g]C)dA6), positioned opposite a thymine residue dT17 in the DNA sequence context d(C1-T2-C3-T4-C5-(B[g]C)A6-C7-T8-T9-C10-C11). d(G12-G13-A14-A15-G16-T17-G18-A19-G20++ +-A21-G22) (designated (B[g]C)dA. dT 11-mer duplex), has been studied using structural information derived from NMR data in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.
