In similar transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells, overexpression of the wt human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, RB, was found to repress the serum-induced IL-6 (-225 to +13), c-fos (-711 to +42), and beta-actin (-3400 to +912) promoters but not the PRV-induced IL-6 (-110 to +13) or the serum-induced MHC (-528 to -38) promoters.
