Most kinases are not significantly inhibited by roscovitine. cdc2/cyclin B, cdk2/cyclin A, cdk2/cyclin E and cdk5/p35 only are substantially inhibited (IC50 values of 0.65, 0.7, 0.7 and 0.2 microM, respectively). cdk4/cyclin D1 and cdk6/cyclin D2 are very poorly inhibited by roscovitine (IC50 > 100 microM).
