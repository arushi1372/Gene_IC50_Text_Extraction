TCR alpha and beta gene expression may be regulated by a common set of T-cell nuclear proteins in that the T beta 2 element binding a set of cyclic AMP response element-binding proteins that are also bound by the T alpha 1 element of the human TCR alpha enhancer and the decamer element present in a large number of human and murine TCR beta promoters.
