The aims of this study were to determine and rank the frequency of self reported visual disability in daily tasks performed by glaucoma patients; to examine the interrelation between disabilities using factor analysis; to study the relation between perceived visual difficulty and a measure of the severity of visual field loss; to develop a glaucoma specific subgroup of questions; and examine the validity and reliability of this subgroup of questions.
