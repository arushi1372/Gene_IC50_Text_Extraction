METHODS: Experiments testing the new catheter and comparing it to the existing catheter included: (1) measurement of the laser output beam sizes and divergences; (2) evaluation of particulate matter generation during ablation of atherosclerotic tissue; (3) measurement of ablation hole sizes and tissue penetration rates; (4) histopathologic examination of laser-induced in vivo vessel wall injury.
