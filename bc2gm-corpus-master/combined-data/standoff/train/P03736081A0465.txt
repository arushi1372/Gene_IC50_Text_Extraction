When the coronary sinus pressure reached 15 torr, there was a significant decrease in cardiac index (3.60 +/- 0.5 to 2.70 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2, p less than 0.001), coronary blood flow (13.7 +/- 3.1 to 7.0 +/- 2.1 ml/min, p less than 0.001), rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (1,567 +/- 275 to 1,331 +/- 314, p less than 0.05), and an increase in coronary arteriovenous difference (62.8% +/- 9.3% to 70.5% +/- 5.4% saturation, p less than 0.03).
