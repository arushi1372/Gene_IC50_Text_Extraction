We have demonstrated previously that two binding sites in the -184 HNF-3 beta promoter are recognized by widely distributed factors and that there is also a critical autoregulatory site, we identified a binding site for a cell-specific factor, LF-H3 beta, that may function in restricting HNF-3 beta gene expression to hepatocytes.
