The current study demonstrates that T3-activated transcription of the NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (P450R) gene is dependent on the thyroid hormonal status of the animal, with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways being important in regulating the cellular P450R mRNA level.
