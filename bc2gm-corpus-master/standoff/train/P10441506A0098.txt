PKNbeta had high sequence homology with PKNalpha, originally isolated PKN, especially in the repeats of charged amino acid-rich region with leucine-zipper like sequences (CZ region/HR1), in the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, and in approximately 130 amino acid stretch (D region/HR2), located between CZ region/HR1 and the catalytic domain.
