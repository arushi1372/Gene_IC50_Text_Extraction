In addition, and in support of a mediating role of STATs in the activation of the p21 promoter, overexpression of Stat3 potentiated the cytokine effect on the p21 promoter; whereas a dominant negative Stat3, or a mutation of the STAT response element on the promoter, significantly reduced the cytokine effect.
