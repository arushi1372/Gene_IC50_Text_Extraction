Mean total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume increased significantly, and the mean closing volume, the lung volume above residual volume at which phase IV begins, decreased significantly with 11 cm H20 continuous positive airway pressure; differences at 5 cm H20 were not significant.
