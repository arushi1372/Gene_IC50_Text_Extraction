The centromeric YAC contig, which consists of 23 overlapping YACs and orders 19 sequence-tagged sites (STSs), covers a minimum of 2.2 Mb and spans the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint. c-ets 1 and Fli-1, two members of the ets family, have been linked within 400 kb of intervening DNA within this contig, which also comprises a polymorphic microsatellite, D11S912 (CA)n, which we have localized within the Fli-1 gene.
