We compared the parameters pleural adenosine deaminase (PADA, determined in 405 patients), the PADA/serum ADA ratio (P/SADA; 276 cases), pleural lysozyme (PLYS, 276 cases), the PLYS/serum LYS ratio (P/SLYS; 276 cases), and pleural interferon gamma (IFN, 145 cases) regarding their ability to differentiate tuberculous pleural effusions from others.
