However, in the subgroup with normal Ht (< 0.45 l/l; n = 201) there was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of the mortality after 3 months (27% and 16%, respectively) and an increase of independence at home (35% and 48%, respectively) due to a reduction of the viscosity by means of haemodilution with albumin (a specific viscosity effect in the normovolaemic group).
