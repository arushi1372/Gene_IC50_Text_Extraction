When the coding segments, including both framework and complementarity-determining regions, of these genes and the murine probe sequences are compared by metric analysis, it is apparent that the caiman genes are only slightly more related to each other than to the mammalian sequence, consistent with significant preservation of nucleotide sequence over an extended period of phylogenetic time.
