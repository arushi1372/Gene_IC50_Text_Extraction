To identify structural features of residues flanking the c-region that influence the fidelity and efficiency of signal peptidase cleavage as well as co-translational translocation, we introduced six amino acid substitutions into the COOH terminus of the hydrophobic core and seven substitutions at the NH2 terminus of the mature region (the +1 position) of a model eukaryotic preprotein-human pre(delta pro)apoA-II.
