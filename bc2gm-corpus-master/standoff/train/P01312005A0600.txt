Analysis of the entire 16.7-kb mt genome determined that a MDP1 mediates cleavage of chick mtDNA in vitro at three H- and two L-strand sequence-specific target sites located within a 90-bp A + T-rich genomic tract, theoretically capable of forming stable secondary structures, approximately 200 bases upstream from the H-strand origin (OH) of replication.
