Of these proteins, five have previously been shown to be phosphorylated during mitosis (epithelial-microtubule associated protein-115, Oct91, Elongation factor 1gamma, BRG1 and Ribosomal protein L18A), five are related to proteins postulated to have roles in mitosis (epithelial-microtubule associated protein-115, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc5, innercentrosome protein, BRG1 and the RNA helicase WM6), and nine are related to transcription factors (BRG1, negative co-factor 2alpha, Oct91, S. pombe Cdc5, HoxD1, Sox3, Vent2, and two isoforms of Xbr1b).
