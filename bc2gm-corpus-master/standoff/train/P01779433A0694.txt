First, the finding of a monomeric Alu family repeat at the junction between nonhomology block I and homology block Y of the alpha 2 gene-containing unit in rhesus macaque suggests that the dimeric Alu family repeat, Alu 3, at the orthologous position in human was generated by insertion of a monomeric Alu family repeat into the 3' end of another preexisting Alu family repeat.
