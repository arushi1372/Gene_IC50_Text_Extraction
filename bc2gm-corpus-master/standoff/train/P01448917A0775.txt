Comparisons with the available amino acid residue (aa) sequence information from the complete CPMV RNA 1 sequence and the partial sequence of red clover mottle virus RNA 1 suggest that CPSMV RNA 1 specifies the expected set of five mature proteins: 32K proteinase cofactor, 58K presumed helicase, VPg 5'-linked protein of the genomic RNAs, 24K proteinase, and 87K presumed polymerase, separated by four cleavage sites.
