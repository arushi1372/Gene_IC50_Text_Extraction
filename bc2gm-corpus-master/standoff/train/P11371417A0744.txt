Mechanical ventilation in control lungs produced a 47% decrease in chord compliance, an increase in lung lavage levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (722 +/- 306 pg/ml), interleukin (IL)-1beta (902 +/- 322 pg/ml), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) (363 +/- 104 pg/ml) as compared with low levels of cytokines detected in preventilation data, and no change in percentage of surfactant large aggregates (LA).
