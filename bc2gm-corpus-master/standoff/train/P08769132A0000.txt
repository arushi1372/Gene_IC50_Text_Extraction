The human MSH-2 gene product is a member of a highly conserved family of proteins which are involved in post-replication mismatch repair. hMSH-2 is homologous to Escherichia coli (E. coli) MutS and Sacchromyces cerevisiae MSH-1 and MSH-2 proteins, which recognise heteroduplex DNA at the sites of all single base mismatches and deletions or insertions up to 4 base pairs. hMSH-2 is one of the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) tumor suppressor genes, and maps to human chromosome 2p16.
