The effect of treatment may thus be divided into two main phases--an initial phase with a reduction in LV mass and a reduction in cardiac output and no change in total peripheral resistance--and a second phase with a constant LV mass but an increase in cardiac output to the pretreatment level again and a concomitant decrease in total peripheral resistance.
