Using 16 strains of C. trachomatis in triplicate assays, we found the RT-PCR method consistently more sensitive than the conventional technique for all eight antimicrobials tested, with resultant MICs determined by RT-PCR ranging from 1.6-fold higher (erythromycin) to >/=195-fold higher (amoxicillin).
