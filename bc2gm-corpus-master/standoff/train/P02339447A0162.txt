We have synthesized [7,7-2H2]-19-OHA with high deuterium content and, together with [7,7-2H2]A and [9,11-2H2]estrone (E1), have developed a quantitative assay of serum level 19-OHA, A, and E1 using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-mass fragmentography method to monitor individual subjects throughout pregnancy.
