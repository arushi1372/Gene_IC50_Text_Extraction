The peak velocities of the atrial systolic waves of the transmitral and pulmonary venous flow velocities (A and PVA, respectively) and first systolic wave (PVS1) of pulmonary venous flow, durations of both atrial systolic waves, and amplitude of interatrial septal motion during atrial systole increased significantly ten days after cardioversion compared with those measured within a day of cardioversion in all patients except the 5 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
