The coding sequence for a 260-amino-acid residue polypeptide was interrupted by a single short intron of 60 base pairs (bp), and about 70% of the deduced amino acid sequence of the Drosophila PCNA was identical to the rat and human PCNA polypeptides, with conserved unique repeats of leucine in the C-terminal region.
