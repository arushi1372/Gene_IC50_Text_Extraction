As expected, glycosylation of Env produced from mutants was affected but, irrespective of the glycosylation phenotype, (i) similar quantities of Env were synthesized, (ii) the immunoreactivity of V3 was similar, (iii) gp160 was efficiently cleaved into gp120 and gp41, (vi) Env was exposed at the cell membrane, (v) secreted gp120 bound CD4, and (vi) membrane gp41 was able to induce membrane fusion with CD4+ cells.
