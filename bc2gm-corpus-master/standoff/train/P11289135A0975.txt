Coexposure to FP also resulted in a more pronounced and sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase cascade after PMA treatment, although disruption of this pathway by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 inhibitor U0126 did not prevent potentiation of apoptosis.
