Characterization of these R subunits by their 8-azido-cAMP photoaffinity labeling and immunoreactivity, as well as by a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicated subunit sizes of RII beta (53 kDa) greater than RII alpha dephosphoform (51 kDa) greater than RI alpha (49 kDa).
