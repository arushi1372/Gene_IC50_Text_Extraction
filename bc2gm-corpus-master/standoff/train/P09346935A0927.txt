Thus, ZNF74 sublocalization in nuclear domains enriched in pre-mRNA maturating factors, its RNA binding activity, and its direct phosphodependent interaction with the pol IIo, a form of the RNA polymerase functionally associated with pre- mRNA processing, suggest a role for this member of the KRAB multifinger protein family in RNA processing.
