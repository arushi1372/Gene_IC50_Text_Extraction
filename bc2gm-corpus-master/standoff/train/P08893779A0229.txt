Frozen/thawed extensor digitorum longus muscle tendon units had significantly lower values for load to failure (p < 0.01), energy absorbed to failure (p < 0.01), and strain at failure (p < 0.01), and they tended to fail at a different anatomic location (p < 0.01) (broadly at the fascia-muscle interface as compared with horizontally at the musculotendinous junction) than fresh units.
