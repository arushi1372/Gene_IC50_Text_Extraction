The bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine and colestipol), nicotinic acid, fenofibrate and inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (e.g. lovastatin or simvastatin) are the most effective drugs for use in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia; these agents reduce plasma concentrations of total and LDL-cholesterol by 15 to 45%.
