When statistically analyzed in various subgroupings, the obtained average sedimentation coefficients and polydispersity profiles supported the following conclusions: (a) loss of proteoglycan aggregation and sedimentability is confirmed to be a primary sign of cartilage matrix degradation; (b) higher S values for proteoglycans of the high weight (HW)-bearing areas and lower values for those of the low weight (LW)-bearing areas were a typical finding in normal cartilage samples; (c) inversion of this pattern was indicative of matrix degradation, suggesting that the HW regions are more affected than the LW-bearing areas; (d) the average S value distribution across cartilage thickness tended to resemble the corresponding proteoglycan content versus distance from articular surface; and (e) the deepest cartilage layer had, in most cases, the smallest amount of aggregates while the highest average sedimentability was observed at the middle zone of the normal samples.
