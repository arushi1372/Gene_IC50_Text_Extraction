Analysis of the 5' end of the mouse Elavl1 (mHuA) gene reveals a transcriptional regulatory element and evidence for conserved genomic organization. mHuA (Elavl1) belongs to a highly conserved family of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and has been linked to cell growth and proliferation through its regulation of mRNA stability.
