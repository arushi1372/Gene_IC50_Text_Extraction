OBJECTIVES: To measure coagulation factor VIII:coagulant (F.VIII:C) and C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), hemostasis-associated acute-phase reactant proteins and coagulation factors VII (F.VII), IX (F.IX), and X (F.X), hemostasis proteins not associated with an acute-phase response, in a select population of horses with colic and hemostasis abnormalities, and presumed to have acute-phase changes.
