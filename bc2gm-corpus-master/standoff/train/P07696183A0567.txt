However, there were some properties of Rak that are distinct from Src-like kinases: (a) expression of Rak was predominantly in epithelial-derived cell lines and tissues, especially normal liver and kidney, and cell lines of breast and colon origin; (b) Rak does not harbor the NH2-terminal glycine essential for myristylation and membrane localization; and (c) Rak possesses a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal in the SH2 domain, and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that p54rak resides predominantly in the nucleus.
