To explore the mechanism of RSK activation, a cloned human RSK cDNA (RSK3) was used to generate and characterize several site-directed RSK mutants; K91A (N-Lys, NH2-terminal ATP-binding mutant), K444A (C-Lys, COOH-terminal ATP-binding mutant), N/C-Lys (double ATP-binding mutant) T570A (C-Thr, mutant of the putative MAPK phosphorylation site in subdomain VIII of the C-domain), S218A (N-Ser, mutant of the corresponding NH2-terminal residue).
