Thus, these studies on rat Std promoter function indicate that (i) HNF1 and C/EBP are responsible for liver specificity of the rat Std gene; (ii) androgenic repression of the gene requires the presence of all of the OCT-1 and C/EBP elements between positions -231 and -292; and (iii) AR may exert its negative regulatory effect indirectly through transcriptional interference of OCT-1 and C/EBP rather than through a direct DNA-AR interaction.
