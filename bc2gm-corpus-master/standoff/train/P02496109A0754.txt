However, experiments with S1 mapping of in vivo transcripts, gene disruptions in the alpha region, and a single-copy transcriptional fusion vector all suggested that these possible promoters were largely inactive during logarithmic growth, that the major promoter for the alpha operon lay upstream from the region cloned, and that the genes in the IF1 to L17 interval were cotranscribed.
