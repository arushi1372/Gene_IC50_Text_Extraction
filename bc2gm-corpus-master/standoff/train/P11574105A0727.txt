Patients with antibody peaks, defined as fivefold or higher increase in antibody titer compared to the lowest antibody titer over the course of GBS, had higher disability scores during the first two weeks of GBS and a worse clinical outcome (anti-GM1 IgG and anti-GD1a IgM antibody peaks) and axonal damage (anti-GD1a IgM antibody peaks), compared to patients without peak antibody titers.
