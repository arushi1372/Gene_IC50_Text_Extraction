The less-polar mycolic acid-containing Rhodococcus species showed chromatographic patterns that partially overlapped (in elution times) the patterns of Nocardia asteroides, N. otitidiscaviarum, and N. brasiliensis, but the larger number of peaks in the last species made separation between the genera possible.
