We show here that v-Rel specifically increased expression from a reporter plasmid containing multiple Sp1 binding sites approximately sixfold in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), even though v-Rel did not bind directly to these sites. v-Rel also increased expression from a reporter plasmid containing a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) in which the kappa B binding sites were mutated but which still contained intact Sp1 binding sites.
