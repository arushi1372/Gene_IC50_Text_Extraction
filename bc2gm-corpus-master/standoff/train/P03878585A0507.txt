The percentage RFR reduction at the end of CPB showed significant correlation with 1) CPB duration (r = 0.49), 2) oxygen flow rate index (OFRI), i.e. flow/min in the bubble oxygenator/m2 bsa (r = 0.38), and 3) blood flow rate index (BFRI), i.e. average volume of blood pumped through the heart-lung machine/min CPB time/m2 bsa (r = 0.51).
