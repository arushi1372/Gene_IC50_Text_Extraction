We have shown previously that GH3 cells transfected with the rat GnRH receptor cDNA (GGH3-1' cells) support the expression of a cotransfected fusion gene composed of 797 base pairs of rat LHbeta gene 5'-flanking sequence and the first 5 base pairs of the 5'-untranslated region fused to a luciferase reporter (-797/+5LHbetaLUC) and respond to a GnRH agonist with a 10-fold stimulation of activity.
