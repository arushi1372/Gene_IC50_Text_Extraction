Is nisoldipine capable of reducing left ventricular preload? In ten anesthetized pigs, nisoldipine (2-4 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), a calcium channel blocker structurally related to nifedipine, reduced left ventricular systolic pressure (40%) and systemic vascular resistance (35%), whereas maxLVdP/dt decreased by 20% and cardiac output was unchanged.
