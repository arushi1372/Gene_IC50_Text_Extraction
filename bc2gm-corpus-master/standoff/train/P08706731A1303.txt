We identify considerable spatio-temporal similarities between reported expression patterns of Ypr10 genes and ribonuclease genes, which, together with the significant sequence similarity to the ginseng ribonuclease, support the hypothesis of a ribonuclease function for PR-10 proteins and allow the prediction of possible biological roles.
