During the 2h resuscitation period, extracellular aspartate and glutamate concentrations in the cerebral striatum were higher during hypoxaemic resuscitation (p = 0.044 and p = 0.055, respectively) than during resuscitation with 21% O2 or 100% O2, suggesting an unfavourable accumulation of potent excitotoxins during hypoxaemic resuscitation.
