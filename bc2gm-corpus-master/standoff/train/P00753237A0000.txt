A--A natural hydrostatic phenomenon, at the level of the ends of the plantar arcs, diffuses body weight, as PAIN plays the role of outsentry (fig.--1) (5); B--Plantar perforating ulceration (PPU) is caused by a combination of INSENSITIVITY and TRAUMATIS (1); C--The patient reposing, as body weight (traumatism) effects disappear, cicatrization process can be easily observed; D--PNEUMATIC INSOLE, being elastic, diffuses localized compression at the ends of the plantar arcs, reduces attrition, makes easier blood circulation, as well as cure and prophylaxis of PPU (fig.--6) (3).
