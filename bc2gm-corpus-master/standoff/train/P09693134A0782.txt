Specifically, I use molecular markers that identify particular neuroectodermal domains, all neuroblasts or individual neuroblasts, to show that in DER mutant embryos (1) intermediate column neuroblasts do not form, (2) medial column neuroblasts often acquire identities inappropriate for their position, while (3) lateral neuroblasts develop normally.
