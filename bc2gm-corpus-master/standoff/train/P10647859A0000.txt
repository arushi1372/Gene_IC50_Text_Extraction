To quantify any mechanical inhibitory effect of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) on inspiratory activity of the diaphragm we ventilated five conscious relaxed subjects on two occasions at respiratory rates similar to quiet breathing (QB) and at three levels of applied pressure (Pappl)--6, 9 and 12 cmH2O, each during hypocapnia (P(CO2) allowed to decrease) and eucapnia (CO2 added to inspired gas).
