Gtx mRNA accumulates in parallel with the RNAs encoding the major structural proteins of myelin, myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP) during postnatal brain development; Gtx mRNA decreases in parallel with MBP and PLP mRNAs in the brains of myelin-deficient rats, which have a point mutation in the PLP gene.
