Conjugated and unconjugated phenylacetic acid and m- and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid have been determined in the plasma of normal, healthy subjects after fasting, consumption of a meal and ingestion of deuterium labelled amine precursors, by high-resolution gas chromatography--high resolution mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring of their trifluoroethyl-pentafluoropropionyl derivatives.
