The future of research with interferon may be divided into three areas: Efforts must be made to determine how best to translate the in vitro synergy into clinically meaningful terms; in order to exploit the fullest potential of IFN, research is moving toward using this agent earlier in disease either as an adjuvant after tumor debulking or after initial diagnosis; the medical community must rethink the natural history of some diseases, because the fullest potential of the biologic agents will most likely manifest itself when these agents are used together.
