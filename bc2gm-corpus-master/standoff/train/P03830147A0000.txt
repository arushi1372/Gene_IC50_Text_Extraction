The relationships among four descriptors of lactate increase: lactate threshold (LT) (the VO2 at which blood lactate concentration begins to increase above the resting level during an incremental exercise test), LT1 (the VO2 at which blood lactate increases 1 mM above the resting level), LT2 (the VO2 at which blood lactate concentration reaches a fixed value of 2 mM), onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA; the VO2 at which blood lactate reaches a concentration of 4 mM), were compared with aerobic capacity (VO2max) and 12 min running performance in 19 untrained female students.
