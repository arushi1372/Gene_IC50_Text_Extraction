The murine chromosomal locations of the five NMDA receptor channel subunits, the epsilon 1 (Grin2a), epsilon 2 (Grin2b), epsilon 3 (Grin2c), epsilon 4 (Grin2d) and zeta 1 (Grinl) subunits, were determined using an interspecific backcross mapping panel derived from crosses of [(C57BL/6JxM. spretus) F1xC57BL/6J] mice.
