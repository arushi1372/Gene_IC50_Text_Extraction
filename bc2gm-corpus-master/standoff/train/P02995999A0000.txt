The sequence analysis of both products of individual phi 80 site-specific recombination events in vivo shows that recombination with a secondary attachment (att) site generates several different novel joints at the mismatched position: one recombination event resulted in a single base-pair deletion and two other recombination events resulted in two different single base-pair substitutions.
