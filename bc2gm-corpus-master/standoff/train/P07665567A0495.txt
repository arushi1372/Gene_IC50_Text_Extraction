Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the CD69 gene revealed the presence of a potential TATA element 30 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site and several putative binding sequences for inducible transcription factors (NF-kappa B, Egr-1, AP-1), which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene.
