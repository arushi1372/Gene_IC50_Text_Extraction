In a Hoosier Oncology Group randomized study involving extensive-disease SCLC patients, VIP was superior to etoposide/cisplatin with regard to median time to progression (6.6 v 5.8 months), median survival times (9.1 v 7.3 months), and 2- and 3-year survival rates (13% v 5% and 5% v 0%, respectively).
