These results suggest that the M. jannaschii as well as related archaeal 20S proteasomes require a nucleotidase complex such as PAN to mediate the energy-dependent hydrolysis of folded-substrate proteins and that the N-terminal 73 amino acid residues of PAN are not absolutely required for this reaction.
