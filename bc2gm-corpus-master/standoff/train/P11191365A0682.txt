Susceptibility to ischemia-induced arrhythmias was lower in 1-week diabetics: only 42 % of diabetic hearts exhibited ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 16 % had short episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) as compared to VT 100 % and VF 70 % (including sustained VF 36 %) in the non-diabetics (P<0.05).
