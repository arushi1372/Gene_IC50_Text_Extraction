We cloned and sequenced the cDNAs against genomic RNA and mRNA for phosphoprotein (P) of human parainfluenza type 2 virus (PIV-2). cDNA clone from genomic RNA was 1439 nucleotides in length excluding poly(A) and was found to have two small open reading frames encoding proteins of 233 and 249 amino acids.
