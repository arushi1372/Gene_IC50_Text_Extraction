A new semi-automatic method for quantifying regional cerebral uptake of 99m technetium-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) was used to assess single photon emission tomograms from 5 normal subjects, 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 14 patients with dementia of frontal lobe type and 4 patients with dementia with motor neurone disease.
