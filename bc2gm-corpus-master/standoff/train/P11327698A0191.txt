Here we show that PKC and p44/p42MAPK signalings are required for the HBx-induced Sp1-mediated IGF-II P4 transcriptional activity since (i) PKC activation by PMA or PKC expression vector increases Sp1 phosphorylation and P4 activity in HBx-transfected HepG2 cells; (ii) PKC inhibition by PKC inhibitor Go6976 reduces Sp1 phosphorylation, P4 activity, and IGF-II mRNA in HBx-transfected HepG2 cells; and (iii) the inhibition of MEK activation by U0126 reduces Sp1 phosphorylation, P4 activity and IGF-II mRNA in HBx-transfected HepG2 cells.
