The gene lac-1, encoding the enzyme laccase, is the best characterized of a number of genes in the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, that are repressed by hypoviruses, a group of virulence-attenuating mycoviruses. lac-1 has also been shown to be transcriptionally activated by low concentrations of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A.
