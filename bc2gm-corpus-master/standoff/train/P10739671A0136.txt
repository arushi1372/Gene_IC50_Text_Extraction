By electrophoresis mobility shift assays using probes corresponding to different segments of the putative human c-myb intron 1 transcription pause region and nuclear extracts from myeloid leukemia HL 60 and fibroblast WI 38 cells, we detected a HL-60-specific DNA-protein complex with a 123-bp fragment containing binding sites for the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) nuclear proteins.
