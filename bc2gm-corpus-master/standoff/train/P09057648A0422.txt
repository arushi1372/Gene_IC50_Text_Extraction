Transient cotransfection of tat cDNA in sense orientation (tat/S), together with a plasmid containing the c-fos promoter (FC3, from -711 to +42) in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene significantly enhanced CAT activity in Jurkat cells activated by the addition of 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) or 5 micrograms/mL phytohemagglutinin plus 10(-7) mol/L phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and U937 cells activated by 15% FCS or 10(-7) mol/L PMA.
