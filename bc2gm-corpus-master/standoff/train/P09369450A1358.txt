Thus, the synergistic effects of HNF-1beta and the GR on dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity require that they are bound to the HNF-1 site and the GRE, respectively, and may involve protein-protein interactions between the transcription factors, or between them and the basal transcription machinery or a steroid receptor coactivator.
