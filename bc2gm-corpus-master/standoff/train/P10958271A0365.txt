METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively compared the automated measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and volumes from rest-injected gated Technetium 99m (Tc99m) perfusion SPECT with equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA) in 62 patients and the assessment of regional function with echocardiography in 22 patients.
