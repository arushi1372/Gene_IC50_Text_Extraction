In order to investigate to what extent this interaction might contribute to tumor induction by the virus, we have introduced two different point mutations within the putative pRb-binding sequence of large T antigen, and as a preliminary to in vivo experiments we have studied their effects in vitro on some biological activities relevant to tumor induction.
