The percutaneous absorption of clindamycin was studied in healthy male volunteers, comparing two investigative clindamycin (% w/v)/tretinoin (0.025% w/v) gels, containing clindamycin phosphate ester and clindamycin HCl, respectively, relative to a clindamycin phosphate lotion (1% clindamycin; Dalacin T).
