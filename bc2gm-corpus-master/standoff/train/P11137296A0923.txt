Four transcription initiation sites have been identified by full-length RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) between -61 and -32 bp from the translation initiation codon.Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that PFK-A, PFK-B and PFK-C genes were expressed, in all mouse tissues tested, at varying levels.
