An economic analysis using West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) findings indicates that statin treatment would have prevented 318 events per 10,000 patients in a population similar to that in WOSCOPS (average 1.5% annual risk of a cardiovascular event) at a discounted cost per life-year gained of 20,375 pounds($31,818).
