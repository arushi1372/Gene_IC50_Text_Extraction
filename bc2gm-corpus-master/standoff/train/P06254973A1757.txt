Poly(dT) and denatured calf thymus DNA were more effective than were other polynucleotides tested in promoting accumulation of 19 HDP*; (dT)8 was as effective as were longer molecules of (dT)n, but (dT)4 and (dT)6 were much less effective, indicating that the binding site involved in 19 HDP* accumulation covered between 6 and 8 residues of (dT)n.
