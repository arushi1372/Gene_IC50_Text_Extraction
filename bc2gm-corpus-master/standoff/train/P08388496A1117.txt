Expression in established LCLs, occurring irrespective of virus producer status, was not a consequence of continued in vitro passage; thus, appropriately spliced BamHI-A transcripts could be amplified from normal B cells within 1 day of their experimental infection in vitro, along with BamHI-C/W promoter-initiated but not BamHI-F promoter-initiated mRNAs.
