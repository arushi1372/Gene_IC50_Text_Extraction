Our findings confirm the high frequency of proximal nerve lesions in early GBS and CIDP, not all of which are associated with distal motor conduction abnormalities, and suggest that assessment of multiple F wave parameters, in particular chronodispersion, mean latency and mean amplitude (in addition to absence and minimum latency), increases the yield of F wave studies.
