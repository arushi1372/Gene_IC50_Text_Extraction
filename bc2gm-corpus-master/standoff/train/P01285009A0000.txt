Gene constructs consisting of human growth hormone (hGH) gene driven by promoter/regulatory sequence of mouse metallothionein (mMT), viral thymidine kinase (vTK), rat cholecystokinin (rCCK), or chicken beta-actin (cBA) gene were injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized medaka eggs via the micropyle.
