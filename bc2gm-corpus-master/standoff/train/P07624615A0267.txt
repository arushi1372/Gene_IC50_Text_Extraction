Acute decrease in body temperature (TB) lowered PaCO2 (32.5 to 14.5 mmHg) and [HCO3-]a(24.20 mEq/L to 17.56 mEq/L), increased pHa (7.481 to 7.608) and diminished the [OH-]/[H+] ratio, but had no significant effect on [SID] or [Atot], although both total phosphorus [PT] and inorganic phosphate [Pi] increased.
