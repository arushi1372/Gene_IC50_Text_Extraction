In addition, a comparison of the hCHLR gene sequences with available databases indicates that a large portion of these genes, including exons encoding two functional domains of the carboxyl-terminal region of these proteins, has been duplicated as part of a larger human telomeric repeat sequence found on many human chromosomes.
