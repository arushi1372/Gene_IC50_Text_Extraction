In F42A-stimulated internalization assays on forskolin-induced YT-1 cells, the IL-2R alpha chain is consistently endocytosed together with the IL-2R beta subunit indicating that IL-2R alpha is stably associated with the F42A-IL-2R beta complex even though the alpha-subunit contributes little if any affinity to the F42A binding reaction.
