These results continue to support the hypothesis that HS2, HS3, and HS4 act as a single, integral unit to regulate human globin gene transcription as a holocomplex, but they can also be interpreted to say that formation of a DNase I hypersensitive holocomplex alone is not sufficient for mediating high-level globin gene transcription.
