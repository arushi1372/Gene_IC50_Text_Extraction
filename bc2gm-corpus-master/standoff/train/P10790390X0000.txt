Genetic and molecular complexity of the position effect variegation modifier mod(mdg4) in Drosophila. mod(mdg4), also known as E(var)3-93D, is involved in a variety of processes, such as gene silencing in position effect variegation (PEV), the control of gypsy insulator sequences, regulation of homeotic gene expression, and programmed cell death.
