Using a natural dominant negative for AP-1 transcriptional activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, we then showed that AP-1 transcription factors mediated TGF-beta1- and BMP-2-regulated expression of the (alpha1) collagen I gene as well as TGF-beta1-regulated expression of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor.
