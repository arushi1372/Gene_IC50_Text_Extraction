In order to evaluate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT)-axis in unipolar depression, the authors measured basal 0800h plasma levels of free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by means of the new, ultrasensitive assays (TSH-IRMA) in 69 healthy controls, 62 minor, 101 simple major, and 57 melancholic depressed subjects.
