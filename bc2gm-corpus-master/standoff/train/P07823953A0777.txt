Using a battery of I kappa B alpha mutants, we show that (i) a dimer binds a single I kappa B alpha molecule, (ii) the acidic C-terminal region of I kappa B alpha is not required for protein-protein binding and does not mask the nuclear localization signal of the dimer, (iii) the same C-terminal region is required for inhibition of DNA binding, and (iv) this inhibition may be accomplished by direct interaction between the PEST-like region and the DNA-binding region of one of the subunits of the dimer.
