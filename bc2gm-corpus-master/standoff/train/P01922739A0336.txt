It was found that the ROSP undergoes a number of fluctuations in the negative and positive directions with a gradually decreasing amplitude in the course of 5-25 days following the operation, after which relatively stable negative values of the ROSP are established on the average in electrodes implanted to the level of the dura mater, and positive values in electrodes implanted to the level of the pia mater.
