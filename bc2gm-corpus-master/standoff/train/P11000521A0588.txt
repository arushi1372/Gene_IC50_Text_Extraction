Studying intracellular signaling pathways, which may be involved in malignant transformation of Ret-9bp expressing NIH3T3 cells, we could demonstrate Ret-9bp dependent phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) with consecutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT).
