Characterization of the 3' ends of the plus-strand DNA fragments reveals (1) that the upstream fragment is elongated beyond PPT2 creating a plus-strand overlap and (2) that the majority of plus-strand strong-stop DNA fragments bear a copy of the minus-strand primer binding site in agreement with the accepted model of retroviral genomic RNA reverse transcription.
