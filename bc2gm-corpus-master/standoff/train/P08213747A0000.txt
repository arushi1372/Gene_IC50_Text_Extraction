To determine whether the excess prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in US black and Hispanic homosexual men relative to white men can be explained by differences in sociodemographic factors, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or sexual and drug-use behaviors, the authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline HIV-1 seroprevalence and HIV-1 risk factors among 4,475 non-Hispanic white, 234 Hispanic white, and 194 black homosexual men from four centers in the United States (Baltimore/Washington, DC, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Los Angeles).
