In contrast, peak filling rate (PFR), normalized to end diastolic volume (EDV), or stroke volume (SV), or expressed as the ratio of PFR-to-PER was reduced (p < 0.01), time to PFR (TPFR) was prolonged (p < 0.01), and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index was higher (p < 0.001) in patients with acromegaly compared to normals.
