In consequence, the gpI derived from cells infected with mO74 showed antigenic characteristics similar to those of gpI from VZV-infected cells as determined from the immunoprecipitation pattern, although the molecular weight of each polypeptide was different, and antibody produced in rabbits infected with recombinant virus had a high neutralizing activity, when the reaction was performed with complement.
