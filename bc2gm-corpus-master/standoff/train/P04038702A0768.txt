The results indicate that: 1) the initial response to tethering varies according to previous penning and handling experience, 2) although the circadian rhythm of cortisol was either altered or disrupted during estrus, such disruptions were not influenced by type of penning and 3) tether stalls may chronically increase cortisol concentrations in gilts.
