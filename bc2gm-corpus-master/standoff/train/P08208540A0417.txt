Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs indicates that, via alternative splicing, the rearranged gene codes for two proteins of 84 and 85 kD (p84/85) which retain the DNA-binding rel domain and the first five ankyrin repeats, but have lost their carboxy-terminus including the seventh ankyrin repeat.
