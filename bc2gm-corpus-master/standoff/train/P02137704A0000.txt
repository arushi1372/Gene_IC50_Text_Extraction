In a highly select group of stable hypertensive patients, we have assessed the strength of association between various blood pressure measurements (24 h average automated ambulatory blood pressure, 4 h automated ambulatory morning average blood pressure, multiple office visit average blood pressure, and a single office visit average blood pressure) and various echocardiographic indices of hypertensive cardiac target organ damage (left atrial diameter, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, posterior wall thickness, combined wall thickness, relative wall thickness, left ventricular mass and mass index, and combined wall thickness/left ventricular diastolic diameter ratio).
