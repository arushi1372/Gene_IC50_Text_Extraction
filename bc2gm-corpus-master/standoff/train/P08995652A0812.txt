The results demonstrate that (i) no intact capsids were assembled when the full-length or a truncated (missing the C-terminal 65 amino acids) UL80.5 protein was tested; (ii) when the C-terminal 65 amino acids of the UL80.5 protein were replaced with the C-terminal 25 amino acids of the UL26.5 protein, intact capsids were made and direct interaction of the UL80.5 protein with VP5 was detected; (iii) assembly of intact capsids was demonstrated when the sequence of the last 12 amino acids of the UL80.5 protein was changed from RRIFVA ALNKLE to RRIFVAAMMKLE; (iv) self-interaction of the scaffold proteins is mediated by sequences N terminal to the maturation cleavage site; and (v) the UL26.5 and UL80.5 proteins will not coassemble into scaffold structures.
