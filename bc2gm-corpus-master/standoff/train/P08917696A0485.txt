To analyze the mechanism of fos/jun activation by TCDD we have used electrophoretic mobility shift and transient expression assays of reporter gene constructs containing response elements for 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TRE), serum (SRE), cAMP (CRE), and aromatic hydrocarbons (AhRE) from the fos and jun genes fused to the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 minimal promoter.
