The pJR vectors differ among them in: (a) the selectable marker (Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEU 2 gene, which complements S. pombe leu1- gene and S. pombe ura4+ and his3+ genes); (b) the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (3X, 41X and 81X with extremely high, moderate or low transcription efficiency, respectively); and (c) the multiple cloning site (two multiple cloning sites, with 12 restriction sites each).
