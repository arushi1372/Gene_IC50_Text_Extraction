The susceptibility of Aspergillus fumigatus to mulundocandin, an echinocandin-like compound, and other antifungal agents was assessed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M38-P method, a 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenyl-amino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT)-based colorimetric assay, and determination of morphologic alterations by microscopy.
