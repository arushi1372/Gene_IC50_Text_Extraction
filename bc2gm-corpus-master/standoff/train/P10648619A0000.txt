We have investigated the contribution of specific TATA-binding protein (TBP)-TATA interactions to the promoter activity of a constitutively expressed silkworm tRNA(C)(Ala) gene and have also asked whether the lack of similar interactions accounts for the low promoter activity of a silk gland-specific tRNA(SG)(Ala) gene.
