When mixed with aqueous solutions of TMT-55, aqueous solutions of either reagent-grade zinc, cadmium, or lead salts precipitate crystalline "Zn-TMT", amorphous or crystalline "Cd-TMT" or amorphous "Pb-TMT" (M3[S3C3N3]2.nH2O, where M=Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ and n> or = 0) that may eventually crystallize if stored in air.
