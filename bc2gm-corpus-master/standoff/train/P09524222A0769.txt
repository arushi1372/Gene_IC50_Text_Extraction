The COOH-terminus of this new isoform, which we designate beta 4, lacks a 22 amino acid lysine-rich sequence common to both the human red cell alpha- and beta-adducin subunits and homologous to a highly conserved region in MARCKS, a filamentous actin-cross linking protein regulated by protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin. beta 4-adducin preserves a previously identified calmodulin binding domain.
