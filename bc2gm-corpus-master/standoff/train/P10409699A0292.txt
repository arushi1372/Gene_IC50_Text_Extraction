Human expressed sequence tag clones were identified by sequence similarity to mammalian and yeast oligosaccharide-processing mannosidases, and the full-length coding region of the putative mannosidase homolog was isolated by a combination of 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and direct polymerase chain reaction from human placental cDNA.
