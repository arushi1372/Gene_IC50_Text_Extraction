The 5' end of the genomic RNA of rubella virus (RUB) contains a 14-nucleotide (nt) single-stranded leader (ss-leader) followed by a stem-and-loop structure [5'(+)SL] (nt 15 to 65), the complement of which at the 3' end of the minus-strand RNA [3'(-)SL] has been proposed to function as a promoter for synthesis of genomic plus strands.
