RBP56 protein turned out to be hTAFII68 which was isolated as a TATA-binding protein associated factor (TAF) from a sub-population of TFIID complexes (Bertolotti A., Lutz, Y., Heard, D.J., Chambon, P., Tora, L., 1996. hTAFII68, a novel RNA/ssDNA-binding protein with homology to the proto-oncoproteins TLS/FUS and EWS is associated with both TFIID and RNA polymerase II.
