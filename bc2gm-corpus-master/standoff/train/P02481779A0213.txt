NIK-244 suppressed coronary ligation- and digitalis-induced arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h and 48-h coronary ligation and digitalis were 0.41 +/- 0.10 (by 1 mg/kg i.v.), 0.70 +/- 0.13 (by 1 mg/kg i.v.), and 0.21 +/- 0.08 (by 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) microgram/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD of the mean, n = 6).
