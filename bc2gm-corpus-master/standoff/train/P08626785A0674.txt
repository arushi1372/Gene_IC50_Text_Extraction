Retinoid-dependent activation of the tissue transglutaminase promoter depends on both a proximal regulatory region containing sequences highly conserved between the human and the mouse tissue transglutaminase promoters and a distal region that includes a 30-base pair retinoid response element (mTGRRE1). mTGRRE1 contains three hexanucleotide half-sites (two canonical and one non-canonical) in a DR7/DR5 motif that bind both RAR*RXR heterodimers and RXR homodimers.
