An analysis of the steady state RNA levels in T-lymphoid cell lines showed that at least three different incomplete proviral transcripts and their spliced products made up the majority of expressed RD-114 mRNA, and further demonstrated that partially deleted proviral loci have the potential to be transcriptionally vigorous in certain feline cell types.
