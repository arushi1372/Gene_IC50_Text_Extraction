The present study investigated dose dependence and time course effects of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) partial inverse agonist, RO19-4603 (0.005-0.30 mg/kg) alone, and in combination with the BDZ receptor antagonists flumazenil, ZK 93426, and CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg) in selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats provided a two-bottle choice test between ethanol (EtOH) (10% v/v), and a palatable saccharin (0.0125% g/v) solution.
