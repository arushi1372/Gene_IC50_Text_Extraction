In summary, the segments of C3 represented by amino acid residues 1082-1118, 1117-1155, 1234-1294 and 1312-1404 accommodate C3(D) epitopes that are expressed by erythrocyte-bound C3 fragments, but not by the corresponding fluid-phase fragment, whereas the segments spanning residues 973-1026 and 1477-1510 contain C3(D) epitopes that are exposed exclusively in denatured C3 and therefore hidden in physiological fragments of the protein.
