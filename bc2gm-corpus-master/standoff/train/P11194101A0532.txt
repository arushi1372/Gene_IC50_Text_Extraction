Baseline BMD values were significantly lower in the oligo-amenorrheic group than in the two others at the level of lumbar spine (anteroposterior view: 0.941+/-0.039 in oligo-amenorrheic vs 1.077+/-0.029 or 1.051 +/-0.017 g x cm(-2), P < 0.005, in the eumenorrheic and contraceptive user groups, respectively) but not in weight-bearing bone such as proximal and midshaft femur.
