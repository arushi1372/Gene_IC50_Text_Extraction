The analysis of two distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways shows that stress-activated protein kinase-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, resulting in the phosphorylation of ATF-2, c-Jun, and JunD, is required not only for the IL-1- but also for the TPA-dependent induction, while the extracellular signal-related kinase 1 (ERK-1) and ERK-2 activation is involved in the TPA- but not in the IL-1-dependent stimulation of the uPA enhancer.
