METHODS: Millipore ultrafiltration membranes of three different pore sizes were used as model lenticule materials.The nominal membrane pore sizes were 0.1 microm, 0.45 microm, and 3 microm; the surface roughness increased in the same order The membranes were coated with a thin layer of collagen I and implanted in a circular pocket of the anterior cornea of adult cats, and were clinically evaluated for the extent of epithelialization and the persistence of epithelial attachment.
