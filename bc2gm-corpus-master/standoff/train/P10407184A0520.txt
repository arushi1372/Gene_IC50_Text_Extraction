For functional studies, two promoter regions were cloned upstream of the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT): (i) phbetaE-B - the plasmid that contains the human (h) promoter region (-2832 to +101) including URE, and (ii) prhbetaE-B - the plasmid that contains the rhesus (rh) promoter region excluding URE as it lacks a 270 bp region of the hbetaAPP promoter (-2435 to -2165).
