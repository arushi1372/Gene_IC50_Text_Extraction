A complementary DNA was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans that encoded a polypeptide of 1438 amino acid residues, CeGAP, which contains a domain with sequence similarity to the COOH-terminal segment (GTPase-activating protein region) of Bcr and other known GTPase-activating proteins of the Rho subfamily.
