This protein, designated p532 based on its predicted molecular weight (EMBO J 15: 5738, 1996), contains multiple structural domains including two regions of seven internal repeats highly related to the cell cycle regulator RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Ran, seven beta-repeat domains characteristic of the beta subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, three putative SH3 binding sites, a putative leucine-zipper and a carboxy-terminal HECT domain characteristic of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases.
