After nerve injury, the nociceptive responses through type I neurons, which are polymodal C-fibers and drive NK1-receptor mechanisms in spinal pain transmission, were completely lost, but without changes in type II ones, which are polymodal C-fibers and drive NMDA receptor-mechanisms, while type III ones, which are capsaicin-insensitive (possibly A-fibers) and drive NMDA-receptor mechanisms, were markedly enhanced.
