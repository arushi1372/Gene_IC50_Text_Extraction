Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of delta gag to the 3' end of molecularly cloned proviral MH2 DNA, in order to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and to compare it with other mht - and myc-containing oncogenic viruses as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene.
