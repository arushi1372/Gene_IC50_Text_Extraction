Comparison of the cDNA-predicted avian TnIcardiac amino acid sequences with known TnI sequences indicated 1) that the presence of an N-terminal extension sequence carrying a dual protein kinase A phosphorylation target site and an adjacent proline-rich segment is an ancient cardiac-specific feature of TnI which has been conserved since the bird/mammal divergence, 2) that features of the near-N-terminal troponin C (TnC)-binding site sequence suggest isoform-specific adaptation of TnI and TnC, and 3) that the avian TnIcardiac internal actin/TnC-binding, actomyosin-inhibitory, domain shows significant sequence divergence from mammalian TnIcardiac sequences, including the absence of a protein kinase C target site which is a cardiac-specific feature of TnI in mammals.
