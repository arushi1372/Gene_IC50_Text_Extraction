A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the T. thermophilus enzyme with that of the Escherichia coli enzyme showed (i) a 37% overall similarity; (ii) the conservation of the Ser residue, which is known to be phosphorylated in the E. coli enzyme, and of the surrounding sequence; and (iii) the presence of 141 extra residues at the C terminus of the T. thermophilus enzyme.
