In the normal, basal (unstimulated) condition there were no significant correlations (p greater than 0.05) between the systolic blood pressure and dopamine (r = 0.09), norepinephrine (r = 0.26), or epinephrine (r = 0.27), nor were there significant correlations between melatonin and dopamine (r = -0.01), norepinephrine (r = -0.26), or growth hormone (r = 0.17).
