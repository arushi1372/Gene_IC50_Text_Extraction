Five modalities of nonpharmacologic approaches are recommended at present for lifestyle modification and control of arterial blood pressure elevation: 1) weight reduction to ideal body weight, since it reduces risk of hypertension as well as overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; 2) dietary sodium restriction to less than 2 g a day, without assurance that it will normalize arterial pressure although it may help reduce dosage and numbers of prescribed antihypertensive drugs; 3) moderation of alcohol consumption to less than 1 ounce a day; 4) a regular isotonic exercise program; and 5) cessation of tobacco consumption.
