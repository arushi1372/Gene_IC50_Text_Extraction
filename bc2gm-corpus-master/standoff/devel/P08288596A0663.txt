We found that T3 (10(-8) M) selectively stimulates transcription from rGH-TRE- and TREpal-, but not ME-TRE- and F2-TRE-, containing templates in which these TREs are linked in front of the rGH minimal promoter containing only the TATA box binding protein, but not any other proximal binding protein, sequence.
