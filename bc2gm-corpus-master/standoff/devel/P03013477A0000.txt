In order to study the influence of iron overload on the polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) metabolism of patients on chronic hemodialysis, generation of superoxide anion (O2-) by PMN in whole blood was compared in two groups of hemodialyzed patients: group A consisted of twenty-one individuals with serum ferritin levels above 1000 ng/ml and group B of nineteen individuals with serum ferritin levels below 1000 ng/ml.
