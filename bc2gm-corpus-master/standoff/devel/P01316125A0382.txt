Two points are indicated: first, the photosensitized damage of YHPD is interrelated to not only 1O2, but also free radicals (O2-. .OH and YHPD-.); second, although the photosensitized damage of YHPD is stronger than that of BHPD, yet the photosensitized damage is negatively correlated to the yield of 1O2 but positively correlated to those of O2-. and OH.
