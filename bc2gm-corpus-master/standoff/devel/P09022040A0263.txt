Because L-plastin expression in tissue-specifically regulated in both humans and rodents, it is likely that similar mechanisms regulate L-plastin gene expression in human and rodent cells and that they could be identified by comparing the function and nucleotide sequences of the human and murine L-plastin gene promoters.
