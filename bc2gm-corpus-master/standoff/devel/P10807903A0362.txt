D5/D1(CT) or D5/D1D(CT) tail substitution mutants displayed a rank order of potency and agonist affinities virtually mimicking wild-type (wt) D1 receptors, as indexed by both ligand binding and dopamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation assays, and, similar to wt D1 receptors, did not exhibit receptor constitutive activity or responsiveness to inverse agonists.
