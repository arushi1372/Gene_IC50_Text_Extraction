A comparison of the promoters for muMIP-1 beta and muMIP-1 alpha reveals a conserved CK-1 element, but transient expression studies in RAW 264.7 macrophages with proximal fragments of either the muMIP-1 beta or the muMIP-1 alpha 5' promoter fused to a human growth hormone reporter gene link LPS-inducibility in both to promoter segments near to, but not identical with, the consensus CK-1 sequence.
