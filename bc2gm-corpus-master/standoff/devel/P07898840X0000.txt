Pregnancy screening by uterine artery Doppler velocimetry--which criterion performs best? OBJECTIVE: To test whether repeating Doppler studies of the uteroplacental circulation late in gestation will improve the test's power for predicting pregnancy-induced hypertension and fetal growth restriction (FGR), and whether analysis based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments of the uterine arterial waveforms will yield better results than analysis based on either alone.
