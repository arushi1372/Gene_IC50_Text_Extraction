Significantly, two proximal GATA-1-binding sites (-118/-113 and -98/-93) and a region located within -518 to -315bp of the mouse ALAS2 promoter were essential for transcriptional activation during chemically induced differentiation of MEL cells, implying their importance in conferring erythroid specificity to the ALAS2 transcriptional activation.
