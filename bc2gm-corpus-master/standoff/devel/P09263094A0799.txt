MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung elastance (EL) and resistance (RL) were calculated from measurements of airway pressure, esophageal pressure, and airway flow in five anesthetized, paralyzed dogs during sinusoidal forcing at a constant mean airway pressure of 10 cmH2O in a wide range of breathing frequencies (0.2 to 1.0 Hz in intervals of 0.2) and tidal volumes (50, 100, 200, and to 300 mL).
