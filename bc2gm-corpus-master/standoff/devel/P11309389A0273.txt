We previously showed that this proteolysis 1) can be acutely promoted by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 2) requires a metalloprotease activity, 3) generates both shed GHBP and a membrane-associated GHR transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain remnant, and 4) results in down-regulation of GHR abundance and GH signaling.
