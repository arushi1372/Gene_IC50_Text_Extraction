The major transcription factors controlling arginine metabolism in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, ArgR and AhrC, respectively, are homologous multimeric proteins that form l -arginine-dependent DNA-binding complexes capable of repressing transcription of the biosynthetic genes (both), activating transcription of catabolic genes (AhrC only) or facilitating plasmid dimer resolution (both).
