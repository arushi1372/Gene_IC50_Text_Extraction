Basal components of the transcription apparatus (RNA polymerase II, TATA-binding protein) contain activation domains: is the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II a "portable enhancer domain"? Regions rich in serine, threonine, and proline residues can be found in transcriptional activation domains, as well as in the N-terminal parts of mammalian TATA-binding proteins, where they are interrupted by polyglutamine stretches.
