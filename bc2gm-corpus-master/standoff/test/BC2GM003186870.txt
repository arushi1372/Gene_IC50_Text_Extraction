The cases with terminal forces of left ventricular activation in the same direction as the delta wave, superiorly and to the left at -60 degrees or inferiorly and to the right at +120 degrees, forming a single deflection of over 0,12 seconds' duration, are the result of delayed activation of the anterior or posterior fascicle of the left bundle after a long delay.
