Fulminant hepatic failure in these cases could be characterized by: (1) rapid decrease in serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level after discontinuation of ecarazine, (2) prolonged jaundice despite discontinuation of ecarazine, (3) high incidence of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (57%), and (4) histological findings of extensive hepatocellular necrosis ranging from bridging necrosis to massive necrosis.
