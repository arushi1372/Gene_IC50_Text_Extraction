The existence of a TFIIIB assembly pathway leading to the faithful transcription of natural eukaryotic tRNA genes in the absence of TFIIIC provides novel insights into the functional flexibility of the eukaryotic tRNA gene transcription machinery and on its evolution from an ancestral RNA polymerase III system relying on upstream, TATA- centered control elements.
