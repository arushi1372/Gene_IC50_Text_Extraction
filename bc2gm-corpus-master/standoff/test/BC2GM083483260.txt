However, coligation of Fc gamma RIIB1 with B cell Ag receptors (BCR) inhibits BCR-mediated signaling by a mechanism that may involve recruitment of phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, and the SH2 containing inositol 5'phosphatase (SHIP) to the phosphorylated Fc gamma RIIB1 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif.
