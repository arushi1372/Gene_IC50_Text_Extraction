Characterization and targeted disruption of murine Nup50, a p27(Kip1)-interacting component of the nuclear pore complex. p27(Kip1) is a member of the Cip-Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors that binds to cyclin-Cdk complexes and inhibits their catalytic activity in response to antiproliferative stimuli. p27(Kip1) is regulated by several posttranscriptional mechanisms, including subcellular localization.
