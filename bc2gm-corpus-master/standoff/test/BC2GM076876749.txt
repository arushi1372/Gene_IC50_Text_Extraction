Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells have proved a suitable cell system in which to study this association and to produce recombinant CR3, and we show here that another lepidopteran cell line, Trichoplusia niTN-5B1-4 (High-Five) cells, allows the recovery of large amounts of functional recombinant CR3.
