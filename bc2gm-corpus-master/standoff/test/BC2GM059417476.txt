Similar to what was observed for P. putida, a psrA null mutant of P. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpoS promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpoS promoter activity when the psrA gene was provided in trans. psrA mutants of both Pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpoS expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules.
