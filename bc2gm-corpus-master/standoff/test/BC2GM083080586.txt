Transcription of FN promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes carrying the base substitution in one or more of these G-rich sequences both in vivo and in vitro revealed that the base substitution in any G-rich sequence results in reduction of promoter activity, although the downstream GC box (GCd) plays a primary role.
