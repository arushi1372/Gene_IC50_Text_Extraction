Both claR and car are expressed as monocistronic transcripts; the level of transcript declined rapidly after 48h in complex media, but low sustained levels of both transcripts were observed in defined GSPG medium until 96h. claR and car were not significantly expressed in mutants disrupted in the ccaR gene, a regulatory gene that controls positively clavulanic acid and cephamycin biosynthesis.
