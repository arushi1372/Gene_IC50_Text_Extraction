The results of these studies indicate that EHV-1 gp13 is the structural homolog of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein C and further suggest that the epitope-containing N-terminal amino acid sequences of the herpesvirus gC-like glycoproteins have undergone more extensive evolutionary divergence than the C-terminal sequences.
