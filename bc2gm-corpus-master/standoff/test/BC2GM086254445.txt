These include the genes, undefined 1 (UD1), UD2, and UD3, each coding for proteins of unknown function, the ken gene encoding a new Kruppel-like putative transcription factor, the fly homologues of the mammalian mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (thiolase), and the TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TBPH), the first nonvertebrate member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) gene, a new homeodomain gene, and a gene coding for a putative nuclear binding protein (PNBP) that is homologous to maleless, and a Copia-like element.
