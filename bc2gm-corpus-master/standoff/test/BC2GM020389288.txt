From the supposition that there exists a possible connection between certain psychopathological symptoms, and/or syndromes (e.g., hallucinations) and regional cerebral dysfunction, patients suffering from auditory and tactile hallucinations were investigated, in a symptom-oriented study, using the method of technetium-99m-Hexamethyl-propylenamine Oxime (99m-Tc-HMPAO)-Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and compared with normal controls.
