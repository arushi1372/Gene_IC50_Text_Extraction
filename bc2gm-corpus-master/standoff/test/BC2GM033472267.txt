The results indicate that expression of proU in E. coli is directed from two promoters, one (P2) characterized earlier by other workers with the start site of transcription 60 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of the first structural gene (proV), and the other (P1) situated 250 nucleotides upstream of proV.
