Cbl is a signaling molecule with multiple functional domains: an SH2 domain which binds phosphotyrosine residues, a RING finger domain which acts as a ubiquitin ligase, a proline-rich region which serves as a docking site for SH3-containing proteins, phosphotyrosine residues which serve as docking sites for SH2-containing proteins such a CrkL and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a nuclear localization signal.
