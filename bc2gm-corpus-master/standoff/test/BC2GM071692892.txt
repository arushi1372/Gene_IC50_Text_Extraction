Protein sequencing, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and immunoblot analyses identify p54 and p47/48 as members of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3 [forkhead]) family of transcription factors. p54 belongs to the subfamily of HNF3 beta proteins, while p47/48 binding activity includes HNF3 gamma.
