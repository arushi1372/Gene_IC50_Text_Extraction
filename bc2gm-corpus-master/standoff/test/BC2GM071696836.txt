Molecular analysis indicated that inactivation of H-2L expression in nearly every null clone resulted from an apparent deletion or rearrangement of 5'-flanking and 5'-coding H-2L sequences, with breakpoints consistently mapping to within a 550 bp GC-rich region between exon 1 and the middle of intron 2.
