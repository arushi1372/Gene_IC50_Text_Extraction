Thirty minutes after reperfusion, lung lymph flow (QL) increased from 4.3 to 8.3 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05), lymph/plasma protein ratio was unchanged from 0.6, and the lymph protein clearance increased from 2.6 to 4.6 ml/30 minutes (p less than 0.05), data consistent with increased microvascular permeability.
