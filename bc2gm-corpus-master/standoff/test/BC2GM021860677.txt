Our aim was to evaluate this technique by cross-calibrating the DXA method with the carcass chemical analysis in a heterogeneous population of nondiabetic Wistar and diabetic GK rats (21 animals were used for precision error and reproducibility determinations and 26 were used for accuracy studies).
