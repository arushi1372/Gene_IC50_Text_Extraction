Three putative ORFs have significant homology with known proteins: L0968 is a new member of the very large 'seripauperins' family, comprising at least 20 yeast members; L1313 is a new ABC transporter highly homologous to the yeast cadmium resistance protein Ycf1p and to the human multidrug resistance protein hMRP1; the C-terminal part of L1325 present in our sequence is very homologous to the fruit fly abdominal segment formation protein Pumilio.
