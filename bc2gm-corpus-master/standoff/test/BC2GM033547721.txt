Database searches revealed a 50-63% similarity and 34-42% identity with several families of serine proteases, in particular the trypsin-like proteases, members of the glandular kallikrein family (including prostate-specific antigen, nerve growth factor gamma, and epidermal growth factor-binding protein) and the activators for the kringle family proteins (including the human tissue plasminogen activator and human hepatocyte growth factor activator).
