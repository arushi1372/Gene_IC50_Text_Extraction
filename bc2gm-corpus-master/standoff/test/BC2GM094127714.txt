Finally, the conservation of the two residues most sensitive to mutations (Y949 and Y953) in TM11, and in the homologous TM5, of all mammalian P-gps and also in other ABC transporters, suggests that these residues and domains may play an important role in structural as well as mechanistic aspects common to this family of proteins.
