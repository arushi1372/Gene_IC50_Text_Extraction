Using the conflict drinking test as a model, we studied in rats the effect of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers pindolol and cyanopindolol which bind to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, and of the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI 118,551, respectively, which have a negligible affinity for 5-HT receptors.
