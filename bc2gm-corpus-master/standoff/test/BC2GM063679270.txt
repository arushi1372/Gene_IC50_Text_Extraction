When translated in-frame with PKC zeta, a stop codon is located 28 amino acids towards the N-terminus of the divergence point and the intervening sequence lacks an expected initiating methionine. psi PKC zeta is non-functional in terms of protein synthesis since Western blotting with an antibody directed against the C-terminus of PKC zeta failed to reveal a protein smaller than PKC zeta, and synthetic psi PKC zeta RNA failed to support protein synthesis in a translation system in vitro.
