However, it is only loosely associated, or not associated, with viral particles. gp170 is generated by an alternatively spliced Env mRNA using a splice donor and splice acceptor pair localized within the env open reading frame (ORF), which is normally used to generate Bell and Bet transcripts derived from the internal promoter within the env ORF. gp170 is expressed at a level 30 to 50% of the Env precursor gp130.
