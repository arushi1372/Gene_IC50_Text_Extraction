Overexpression of p50 in transient cotransfection studies using the proximal CRP promoter (-125/+9) linked to a luciferase reporter caused a 3-fold increase of luciferase activity, while C/EBPbeta overexpression caused an 18-fold increase; simultaneous overexpression of both transcription factors increased luciferase activity approximately 600-fold.
