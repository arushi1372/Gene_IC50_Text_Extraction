Two SH2 domains of p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein bind synergistically to tyrosine phosphorylated p190 Rho GTPase-activating protein. p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a negative regulator of Ras that functions at a key relay point in signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation.
