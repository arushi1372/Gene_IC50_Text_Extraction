With stimulation beyond the theta-range three phenomena occurred: shift of the burst frequencies to higher or lower harmonics of stimulation frequencies; complex interactions of basic background frequency with rhythm of stimulation ("beating"); return to background theta-burst frequency in spite of continuing stimulation ("escape").
