The model therefore predicts that 1) on-line calculation of airway dead space and end-expired lung volume can be made by the addition of an oxygen sine-wave perturbation component to the mean FIO2; and (2) QS/QT can be measured from the resultant oxygen perturbation sine-wave amplitudes in the expired gas and in arterial and mixed-venous blood and is independent of the mean blood oxygen partial pressure and oxyhemoglobin saturation values.
