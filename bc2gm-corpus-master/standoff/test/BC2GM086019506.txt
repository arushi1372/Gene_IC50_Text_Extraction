Transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with the Gag-Crk fusion protein results in the elevation of tyrosine phosphorylation on specific cellular proteins with molecular weights of 130,000, 110,000, and 70,000 (p130, p110, and p70, respectively), an event which has been correlated with cell transformation.
