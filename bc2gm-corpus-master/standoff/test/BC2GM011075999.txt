The rate of collagen synthesis in normal scar was approximately constant between 6 months and 20 years after the initial wounding, but in both hypertrophic scar and keloid the rate was initially approximately twice that in normal scar, and 2-3 years after wounding it fell to approximately the same level as in normal scar.
