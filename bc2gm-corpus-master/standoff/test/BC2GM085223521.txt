In rats exposed to Cd for 30 d, the levels of urinary excretion of cAMP after treatment with parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroidectomy (PTX), or 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (1 alpha-OH-D3) showed almost the same patterns as those of control rats: the response of urinary cAMP to treatment with PTH was not influenced by continuous oral administration of Cd.
