METHODS AND RESULTS: With an array of 112 unipole, epicardial maps of electrically induced AF in 6 dogs (acute group), self-sustained AF in 6 dogs (chronic group), and sinus rhythm and atrial pacing in 3 dogs (control group) were analyzed before and after creating linear radiofrequency ablation lesions in both atria that eliminated the AF.
