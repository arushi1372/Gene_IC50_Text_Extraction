Tubular dysfunction in renal lithiasis: cause or consequence?] To investigate whether overall tubular dysfunction is encountered in a particular subgroup of patients with urolithiasis, the following parameters of renal tubular function have been measured in fasting morning urine in 124 male stone formers: excretion of lysozyme and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), fractional excretion (FE) or glucose, insulin, bicarbonate after an alkali load, and theoretical phosphate threshold (TmP/GFR).
