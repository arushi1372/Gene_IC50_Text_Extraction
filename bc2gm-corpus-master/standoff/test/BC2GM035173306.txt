The results showed differential activation of each parahippocampal region during verbal memory tasks in which the side activated shifted depending on the nature of the task employed; an increase in rCBF in the left parahippocampal gyrus was associated with retrieval strategy of non-matching, and an increase in rCBF in the right parahippocampal gyrus was associated with retrieval strategy of matching.
