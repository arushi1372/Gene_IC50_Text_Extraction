METHODS: The Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie is a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial that tests the hypothesis that atorvastatin, a hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, decreases the rate of cardiovascular mortality and of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes who have been on hemodialysis treatment for no more than two years.
