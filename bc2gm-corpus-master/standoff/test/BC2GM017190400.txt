Estrogen pretreated castrated males also showed no change in myocardial blood flow after 17 beta-estradiol, but coronary flow velocity decreased (P < 0.05) compared with baseline 1 h after the 200 ng/kg dose (from 1.69 +/- 0.61 to 1.41 +/- 0.42 kHz) and diastolic coronary resistance increased significantly (P < 0.01) compared with control at this time (51 +/- 15 compared with 39 +/- 14 mmHg/mkHz).
