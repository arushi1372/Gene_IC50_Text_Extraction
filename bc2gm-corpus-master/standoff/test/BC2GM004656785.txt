METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of prolonged nitrate therapy between 2 days and 6 weeks during healing after infarction on serial parameters of ventricular remodeling (scar expansion, scar thinning, ventricular dilation, and hypertrophy) and function (asynergy or akinesis plus dyskinesis and ejection fraction) by serial two-dimensional echocardiography, hemodynamics, postmortem topography (computerized planimetry, geometric maps, and radiographs), and collagen content (hydroxyproline) was studied in 64 instrumented dogs randomized 2 days after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to various nitrate regimens (n = 32) over the first 2 weeks (subgroup 1: 2% transdermal nitroglycerin at 8 AM and 4 PM, n = 6; subgroup 2: 2% transdermal nitroglycerin plus 2.6 mg of sustained-release oral nitroglycerin at 8 AM, 3 PM, and 10 PM, n = 5; subgroup 3: oral isosorbide dinitrate, 30 mg at 8 AM and 4 PM, n = 11) or 6 weeks (subgroup 4: isosorbide dinitrate, n = 10) and in matching controls (n = 32).
