In the postoperative patient with tetralogy of Fallot with symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, it is concluded that electrophysiologic study is useful in reproducing clinical episodes of VT and in selecting effective antiarrhythmic medication; a small number of patients with ventricular premature complexes alone will have inducible sustained VT during electrophysiologic study; prognosis of these patients may be improved by treatment that results in prevention of VT induction; and in patients with right ventricular hypertension, VT is likely to be refractory to drug treatment.
