Comparisons of the efficacy of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination have shown that benazepril 20 mg once daily is as effective as or more effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure than hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily and that the combination of benazepril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg has a possibly synergistic effect on diastolic blood pressure.
