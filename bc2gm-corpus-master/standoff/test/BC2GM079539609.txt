When the same single-amino-acid mutations were directly introduced into the parental PV/CBV4-2A genome, chimeric viruses with a large-plaque phenotype and a wild-type PV-like growth pattern were obtained upon transfection, an observation demonstrating that these point mutations alone had a drastic effect on the growth of the PV/CBV4 chimeric virus.
